	<h1 id="scope-of-regulation">Scope of Regulation</h1>

<h4 id="mrpc-rule-71">MRPC Rule 7.1</h4>

<p>Prohibits false or misleading communication about lawyer or lawyer’s services</p>

<h4 id="1st-amendment">1st Amendment</h4>

<p>Applies to attorney advertisements and solicitations (commercial speech doctrine)</p>

<ul>
  <li>State may regulate ads only if the regulation
    <ul>
      <li>protects a substantial interest, and</li>
      <li>the regulation is no broader than necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Substantial interests justifying regulation of attorney advertising &amp; solicitation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preventing false, misleading, and potentially misleading ads.</li>
  <li>Protecting against undue interference with client choice</li>
</ul>

<p>Taste, decorum, dignity, tradition, etc. are not substantial interests</p>

<h1 id="advertising">Advertising</h1>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>Communications aimed at large groups (i.e. the general public or a broad target audience), not targeting particular individuals or limited groups of persons known to be in need of legal services.</p>

<p>May be delivered through various media:</p>

<ul>
  <li>television, radio</li>
  <li>newspapers,  magazines</li>
  <li>yellow pages</li>
  <li>billboards</li>
  <li>bulk mail, mass email</li>
  <li>websites, internet ads</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="limits--requirements">Limits &amp; Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="no-false-misleading-or-deceptive-statements">No False, Misleading, or Deceptive Statements</h3>

<h4 id="claims-about-quality">Claims about quality</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Non-verifiable claims or comparisons (e.g. ‘Best auto accident lawyer in Jacksonville’) are improper.
    <ul>
      <li>Accolades or recognition are permissible if true and source is identified (e.g. ‘Chosen as Superlaywer by Philadelphia Lawyer magazine.’)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Statements about past experience or performance must not be misleading.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: ‘Never lost a jury trial’ would be misleading if the laywer has never had a jury trial, or only had a few.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="client-testimonials--past-results">Client Testimonials &amp; Past Results</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Permitted if
    <ul>
      <li>information is true,</li>
      <li>makes clear that the results of each case are different (i.e., disclaimer), and</li>
      <li>client consents to the use of name</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="factual-professional-and-personal-information-about-attorney">Factual professional and personal information about attorney</h4>

<p>Permitted</p>

<ul>
  <li>if true, and</li>
  <li>does not imply an ability to use improper influence</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<p>“My name is Saul Goodman. I am an attorney and a C.P.A. I handle medical malpractice and personal injury cases. I graduated first in my class from Elon University School of Law in 2010, and I have a degree in accounting from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was raised in Greensboro, serve as President of the Fisher Park Neighborhood Association, and volunteer as a youth soccer coach. I speak fluent Spanish. If you have a legal problem, please call me or send me an email. Your initial consultation is free. My office accepts credit cards.””</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proper, as long as all statements are true.</li>
</ul>

<p>“As many of you know, my father has been a judge on the NC Court of Appeals for 20 years and my brother was recently elected to as a District Court judge in Guilford County. Please call me should you need any legal assistance.””</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improper, even if true, because it implies ability to use improper influence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="identification-of-attorney-advertising">Identification of Attorney Advertising</h3>

<h4 id="mrpc-rule-72c">MRPC Rule 7.2(c)</h4>

<p>Advertisements must include the name and office address of at least one lawyer or law firm responsible for its content</p>

<h1 id="solicitation">Solicitation</h1>

<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>

<h4 id="mrpc-rule-73a">MRPC Rule 7.3(a)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[C]ommunication initiated by or on behalf of a lawyer or law firm that is directed to a specific person the lawyer knows or reasonably should know needs legal services in a particular matter and that offers to provide, or reasonably can be understood as offering to provide, legal services for that matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-person, face-to-face communication</li>
  <li>Live telephone calls</li>
  <li>Targeted, direct-mail</li>
  <li>Real-time electronic contacts (e.g., instant and text messaging)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h2>

<h4 id="mrpc-rule-73b--c">MRPC Rule 7.3(b) &amp; (c)</h4>

<p>Solicitations are prohibited unless</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lawyer has prior professional (attorney-client) relationship with person</li>
  <li>Prospective client and lawyer are family members</li>
  <li>The person solicited is a lawyer, or</li>
  <li>Lawyer’s primary motive is not pecuniary gain
    <ul>
      <li>Solicitation of clients by nonprofit organizations offering free representation for litigation aimed at advancing political goals is permitted, based on 1st Amendment. <em>In re Primus</em> (U.S. 1978); <em>NAACP v. Button</em> (U.S. 1963)</li>
      <li>See also, MRPC Rule 6.1 (Voluntary Pro Bono Service)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even if otherwise permitted, solicitation is prohibited if</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prospective client has requested that lawyer not solicit, or</li>
  <li>Solicitation involves coercion, duress, harassment</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="direct-mail--recorded-phone-messages">Direct Mail &amp; Recorded Phone Messages</h2>

<p>Targeted, “truthful and nondeceptive” direct mail or recorded phone message solicitations of “potential clients known to face particular legal problems” are generally protected commercial speech under the 1st Amendment. <em>Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn.</em> (U.S. 1988)</p>

<p>States may restrict targeted direct mail or recorded phone message solicitations within a limited time of the incident giving rise to the need for legal services.</p>

<ul>
  <li>See <em>Florida Bar v. Went for It, Inc.</em> (U.S. 1995) (upholding 30 day waiting period)</li>
</ul>

<p>States may require that direct-mail and recorded telephone solicitations are identified (on the envelope, or at the beginning &amp; end of the recorded message) as “Lawyer Advertising”</p>

<h2 id="prepaid-legal-services-plans">Prepaid Legal Services Plans</h2>

<p>A lawyer may be a member of a prepaid legal services plan which solicits prospective members in-person or by live telephone calls</p>

<p>The lawyer may not have an ownership or management interest in the plan, nor may the lawyer personally participate in the solicitation</p>

<p>The plan may not solicit persons who it knows are in need of legal services in a particular matter</p>

<h1 id="communicating-fields-of-practice">Communicating Fields of Practice</h1>

<h4 id="mrpc-rule-74">MRPC Rule 7.4</h4>

<p>A lawyer may identify fields of practice in which the lawyer does (or does not) practice</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice limited to …</li>
  <li>We handle …</li>
  <li>Jones &amp; Smith. Personal injury, medical malpractice …</li>
</ul>

<p>But a lawyer may not identify as a “specialist” unless certified as such</p>

<p>Must identify the certifying body</p>

<ul>
  <li>Certified as a Trial Specialist by the State of Ohio,</li>
  <li>Certified as a Trial Specialist by National Association of Trial Attorneys</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hayes v. NY Attorney Grievance Committee</em> (required disclosure for identification as certified specialist violates 1st Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague)</p>

<h2 id="specialist-certification-in-nc">Specialist Certification in NC</h2>

<p>A lawyer may not claim that he or she is a “specialist” unless the lawyer is certified as a specialist by the North Carolina State Bar’s Board of Legal Specialization or a certifying organization that has been approved by the American Bar Association.</p>

<h4 id="requirements">Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Must be licensed and in good standing to practice law in North Carolina;</li>
  <li>Must be substantially involved in the practice area, usually for a minimum of five years;</li>
  <li>Must take a certain number of continuing legal education credits in the specialty area during the three years prior to application;</li>
  <li>Must make a satisfactory showing of qualification in the specialty through peer review; and</li>
  <li>Must achieve a satisfactory score on a written examination in the practice area.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="areas-of-certification">Areas of Certification:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Bankruptcy (subspecialties in consumer &amp; business bankruptcy);</li>

  <li>Workers’ compensation law;</li>
  <li>Social security disability law.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="firm-names-and-letterheads">Firm Names and Letterheads</h1>

<h2 id="general-rule">General Rule</h2>

<p>No false or misleading names may be used</p>

<h2 id="trades-names-the-abc-law-firm">Trades names (“The ABC Law Firm”)</h2>

<p>Permissible as long as such names do not imply a connection with government (‘Greensboro Law Firm’) or with a public or charitable legal organization (‘Red Cross Legal Clinic’)</p>

<p>If such implications are made, a disclaimer (‘Not associated with the Red Cross’) would be required.</p>

<p>A lawyer or firm may also use a distinctive website address (as long as it’s not misleading).</p>

<h2 id="multistate-firms">Multistate firms</h2>

<p>A multistate law firm may use the same name (‘Sidley &amp; Austin’) in each state as long as its letterhead clearly identifies lawyers not licensed in the state where the letterhead is being used:</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smith, Jones &amp; Davis.  <br />
Offices in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.  <br />
Ms. Jones is licensed to practice law in California and New York.  <br />
Mr. Davis and Mr. Smith are licensed to practice law in Illinois.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Permitted if information is truthful and not misleading.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inclusion-of-attorney-names">Inclusion of attorney names:</h2>

<p>Names of deceased and retired partners may continue to be used</p>

<p>If lawyer leaves a firm to assume public office for a ‘substantial period,’ lawyer’s name must be removed</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Partner Jones is elected as a full-time judge; Jones’ name must be removed</li>
  <li>Partner Jones is appointed to fill a judicial vacancy for two weeks; Jones’ name need not be removed</li>
  <li>Partner Jones is appointed as a part-time judge but continues to practice with firm in accordance with state law; Jones’ name need not be removed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="partnerships-associations--affiliations">Partnerships, Associations, &amp; Affiliations</h2>

<p>Firm name may not imply a partnership or association where none exists</p>

<p>A lawyer may not identify herself as a ‘partner,’ ‘associate,’ ‘of counsel,’ or ‘counsel’ with another lawyer or law firm unless such a relationship truly exists.</p>

<p>Firms may claim that they are ‘affiliated’ or ‘associated’ if they have a regular, ongoing relationship (but this may create conflicts of interest)</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<p>A and B, both solo practitioners, share office space. They use letterhead, signs, etc. saying “A &amp; B, Attorneys at Law”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improper, because A &amp; B are not partners</li>
</ul>

<p>Jones &amp; Smith’s letterhead states “Affiliated with Lopez and Sanchez, Mexico City”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proper if there is an ongoing relationship between firms</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="payments-in-exchange-for-referrals">Payments in Exchange for Referrals</h1>

<h2 id="referral-fees">Referral Fees</h2>

<h4 id="mrpc-rule-72b">MRPC Rule 7.2(b)</h4>

<p>Referral fees (i.e. merely for referring a client, without performing any work) are prohibited</p>

<p>Exceptions</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advertising costs</li>
  <li>Fees for membership in legal services plan or non-profit referral service</li>
  <li>Payment for acquiring a law practice</li>
  <li>Reciprocal referrals to other lawyers or non-lawyer professionals, if arrangement is non-exlcusive and disclosed to client</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of Improper Payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lawyer pays a ‘runner’ $1,000 for each referral</li>
  <li>Lawyer pays real estate agent 10% fee for referrals</li>
  <li>Lawyer gives accountant a gift for years of referrals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="political-contributions">Political Contributions</h2>

<p>A lawyer may not make political contributions so as to obtain legal engagements or appointments</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example</h4>

<p>ABC Law Firm donates $50,000 to the election campaign of Judge X. ABC rarely makes political donations. Judge X is elected and immediately appoints ABC to handle all guardianships for the court.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improper, because of the inference that ABC received the appointments in return for the contribution.</li>
</ul>
