<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-81--bar-admission-and-disciplinary-matters">Rule 8.1	— Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</h1>

<p>An applicant for admission to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</p>

<p>(1)	knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or</p>

<p>(2)	fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</p>

<h1 id="rule-82--judicial-and-legal-officials">Rule 8.2	— Judicial and Legal Officials</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge, or other adjudicatory officer or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial office.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>

<h1 id="rule-83--reporting-professional-misconduct">Rule 8.3	— Reporting Professional Misconduct</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer who knows that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, shall inform the North Carolina State Bar or the court having jurisdiction over the matter.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer who knows that a judge has committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question as to the judge’s fitness for office shall inform the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission or other appropriate authority.</p>

<p>(c) This Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</p>

<p>(d) A lawyer who is disciplined in any state or federal court for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct in effect in such state or federal court shall inform the secretary of the North Carolina State Bar of such action in writing no later than 30 days after entry of the order of discipline.</p>

<p>(e) A lawyer who is serving as a mediator and who is subject to the North Carolina Supreme Court Standards of Professional Conduct for Mediators (the Standards) is not required to disclose information learned during a mediation if the Standards do not allow disclosure. If disclosure is allowed by the Standards, the lawyer is required to report professional misconduct consistent with the duty to report set forth in paragraph (a).</p>

<h1 id="rule-84--misconduct">Rule 8.4	— Misconduct</h1>

<p>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>

<p>(a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</p>

<p>(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</p>

<p>(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation that reflects adversely on the lawyer’s fitness as a lawyer;</p>

<p>(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;</p>

<p>(e) state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official;</p>

<p>(f) knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law; or</p>

<p>(g) intentionally prejudice or damage his or her client during the course of the professional relationship, except as may be required by Rule 3.3.</p>

<h1 id="rule-85--disciplinary-authority-choice-of-law">Rule 8.5	— Disciplinary Authority; Choice of Law</h1>

<p>(a) Disciplinary Authority. A lawyer admitted to practice in North Carolina is subject to the disciplinary authority of North Carolina, regardless of where the lawyer’s conduct occurs. A lawyer not admitted in North Carolina is also subject to the disciplinary authority of North Carolina if the lawyer renders or offers to render any legal services in North Carolina. A lawyer may be subject to the disciplinary authority of both North Carolina and another jurisdiction for the same conduct.</p>

<p>(b) Choice of Law. In any exercise of the disciplinary authority of North Carolina, the rules of professional conduct to be applied shall be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) for conduct in connection with a matter pending before a tribunal, the rules of the jurisdiction in which the tribunal sits, unless the rules of the tribunal provide otherwise; and</p>

  <p>(2) for any other conduct, the rules of the jurisdiction in which the lawyer’s conduct occurred, or, if the predominant effect of the conduct is in a different jurisdiction, the rules of that jurisdiction shall be applied to the conduct. A lawyer is not subject to discipline if the lawyer’s conduct conforms to the rules of a jurisdiction in which the lawyer reasonably believes the predominant effect of the lawyer’s conduct will occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-86--information-about-a-possible-wrongful-conviction">Rule 8.6	— Information About a Possible Wrongful Conviction</h1>

<p>(a) Subject to paragraph (b), when a lawyer knows of credible evidence or information, including evidence or information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6, that creates a reasonable likelihood that a defendant did not commit the offense for which the defendant was convicted, the lawyer shall promptly disclose that evidence or information to the prosecutorial authority for the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted and to North Carolina Office of Indigent Defense Services or, if appropriate, the federal public defender for the district of conviction.</p>

<p>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer shall not disclose evidence or information if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the evidence or information is protected from disclosure by law, court order, or 27 N.C. Admin. Code Ch. 1B §.0129;</p>

  <p>(2) disclosure would criminally implicate a current or former client or otherwise substantially prejudice a current or former client’s interests; or</p>

  <p>(3) disclosure would violate the attorney-client privilege applicable to communications between the lawyer and a current or former client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) A lawyer who in good faith concludes that information is not subject to disclosure under this rule does not violate the rule even if that conclusion is subsequently determined to be erroneous.</p>

<p>(d) This rule does not require disclosure if the lawyer knows an appropriate governmental authority, the convicted defendant, or the defendant’s lawyer already possesses the information.</p>
