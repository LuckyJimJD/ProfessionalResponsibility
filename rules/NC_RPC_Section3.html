<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-31--meritorious-claims--contentions">Rule 3.1 — Meritorious Claims &amp; Contentions</h1>

<p>A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established.</p>

<h1 id="rule-32--expediting-litigation">Rule 3.2 — Expediting Litigation</h1>

<p>A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.</p>

<h1 id="rule-33--candor-toward-the-tribunal">Rule 3.3 — Candor Toward the Tribunal</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer;</p>

  <p>(2) fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or</p>

  <p>(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by the lawyer, has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A lawyer who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.</p>

<p>(c) The duties stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</p>

<p>(d) In an ex parte proceeding, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.</p>

<h1 id="rule-34--fairness-to-opposing-party-and-counsel">Rule 3.4 — Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel</h1>

<p>A lawyer shall not:</p>

<p>(1)	unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act;</p>

<p>(2)	falsify evidence, counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely, counsel or assist a witness to hide or leave the jurisdiction for the purpose of being unavailable as a witness, or offer an inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law;</p>

<p>(3)	knowingly disobey or advise a client or any other person to disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal, except a lawyer acting in good faith may take appropriate steps to test the validity of such an obligation;</p>

<p>(4)	in pretrial procedure,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) make a frivolous discovery request,</p>

  <p>(b) fail to make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party, or</p>

  <p>(c) fail to disclose evidence or information that the lawyer knew, or reasonably should have known, was subject to disclosure under applicable law, rules of procedure or evidence, or court opinions;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(5)	in trial, allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, assert personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, ask an irrelevant question that is intended to degrade a witness, or state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil litigant, or the guilt or innocence of an accused; or</p>

<p>(6)	request a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information to another party unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the person is a relative or a managerial employee or other agent of a client; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer reasonably believes that the person’s interests will not be adversely affected by refraining from giving such information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-35--impartiality-and-decorum-of-the-tribunal">Rule 3.5 — Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer representing a party in a matter pending before a tribunal shall not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) seek to influence a judge, juror, member of the jury venire, or other official by means prohibited by law;</p>

  <p>(2) communicate ex parte with a juror or member of the jury venire except as permitted by law;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) unless authorized to do so by law or court order, communicate ex parte with the judge or other official regarding a matter pending before the judge or official;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) engage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal, including:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(A)	failing to comply with known local customs of courtesy or practice of the bar or a particular tribunal without giving opposing counsel timely notice of the intent not to comply;</p>

    <p>(B)	engaging in undignified or discourteous conduct that is degrading to a tribunal; or</p>

    <p>(C)	intentionally or habitually violating any established rule of procedure or evidence; or</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(5) communicate with a juror or prospective juror after discharge of the jury if:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(A)	the communication is prohibited by law or court order;</p>

    <p>(B)	the juror has made known to the lawyer a desire not to communicate; or</p>

    <p>(C)	the communication involves misrepresentation, coercion, duress or harassment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) All restrictions imposed by this rule also apply to communications with, or investigations of, family members of a juror or of a member of the jury venire.</p>

<p>(c) A lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a juror or a member of the jury venire, and improper conduct by another person toward a juror, a member of the jury venire, or the family members of a juror or a member of the jury venire.</p>

<p>(d) For purposes of this rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Ex parte communication means a communication on behalf of a party to a matter pending before a tribunal that occurs in the absence of an opposing party, without notice to that party, and outside the record.</p>

  <p>(2) A matter is “pending” before a particular tribunal when that tribunal has been selected to determine the matter or when it is reasonably foreseeable that the tribunal will be so selected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-36--trial-publicity">Rule 3.6 — Trial Publicity</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the investigation or litigation of a matter shall not make an extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know will be disseminated by means of public communication and will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.</p>

<p>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer may state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the persons involved;</p>

  <p>(2) the information contained in a public record;</p>

  <p>(3) that an investigation of a matter is in progress;</p>

  <p>(4) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation;</p>

  <p>(5) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary thereto;</p>

  <p>(6) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved, when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and</p>

  <p>(7) in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1) through (6):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(A)	the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the accused;</p>

    <p>(B)	if the accused has not been apprehended, information necessary to aid in apprehension of that person;</p>

    <p>(C)	the fact, time and place of arrest; and</p>

    <p>(D)	the identity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a lawyer may make a statement that a reasonable lawyer would believe is required to protect a client from the substantial undue prejudicial effect of recent publicity not initiated by the lawyer or the lawyer’s client. A statement made pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to such information as is reasonably necessary to mitigate the recent adverse publicity.</p>

<p>(d) No lawyer associated in a firm or government agency with a lawyer subject to paragraph (a) shall make a statement prohibited by paragraph (a).</p>

<p>(e) The foregoing provisions of Rule 3.6 do not preclude a lawyer from replying to charges of misconduct publicly made against the lawyer or from participating in the proceedings of legislative, administrative, or other investigative bodies.</p>

<h1 id="rule-37--lawyer-as-witness">Rule 3.7 — Lawyer as Witness</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</p>

  <p>(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</p>

  <p>(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A lawyer may act as advocate in a trial in which another lawyer in the lawyer’s firm is likely to be called as a witness unless precluded from doing so by Rule 1.7 or Rule 1.9.</p>

<h1 id="rule-38--special-responsibilities-of-a-prosecutor">Rule 3.8 — Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor</h1>

<p>The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:</p>

<p>(a) refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause;</p>

<p>(b) make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been advised of the right to, and the procedure for obtaining, counsel and has been given reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel;</p>

<p>(c) not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important pretrial rights, such as the right to a preliminary hearing;</p>

<p>(d) after reasonably diligent inquiry, make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information required to be disclosed by applicable law, rules of procedure, or court opinions including all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal;</p>

<p>(e) not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client, or participate in the application for the issuance of a search warrant to a lawyer for the seizure of information of a past or present client in connection with an investigation of someone other than the lawyer, unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege;</p>

  <p>(2) the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution; and</p>

  <p>(3) there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(f) except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor’s action and that serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial Comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused and exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees or other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.</p>

<p>(g) When a prosecutor knows of new, credible evidence or information creating a reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant did not commit an offense for which the defendant was convicted, the prosecutor shall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) if the conviction was obtained in the prosecutor’s jurisdiction, promptly disclose that evidence or information to (i) the defendant or defendant’s counsel of record if any, and (ii) the North Carolina Office of Indigent Defense Services or, in the case of a federal conviction, the federal public defender for the jurisdiction; or</p>

  <p>(2) if the conviction was obtained in another jurisdiction, promptly disclose that evidence or information to the prosecutor’s office in the jurisdiction of the conviction or to (i) the defendant or defendant’s counsel of record if any, and (ii) the North Carolina Office of Indigent Defense Services or, in the case of a federal conviction, the federal public defender for the jurisdiction of conviction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(h) A prosecutor who concludes in good faith that evidence or information is not subject to disclosure under paragraph (g) does not violate this rule even if the prosecutor’s conclusion is subsequently determined to be erroneous.</p>
