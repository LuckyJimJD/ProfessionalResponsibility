<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-41--truthfulness-in-statements-to-others">Rule 4.1 — Truthfulness in Statements to Others</h1>

<p>In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person.</p>

<h1 id="rule-42--communication-with-persons-represented-by-counsel">Rule 4.2 — Communication With Persons Represented By Counsel</h1>

<p>(a) During the representation of a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order. It is not a violation of this rule for a lawyer to encourage his or her client to discuss the subject of the representation with the opposing party in a good-faith attempt to resolve the controversy.</p>

<p>(b) Notwithstanding section (a) above, in representing a client who has a dispute with a government agency or body, a lawyer may communicate about the subject of the representation with the elected officials who have authority over such government agency or body even if the lawyer knows that the government agency or body is represented by another lawyer in the matter, but such communications may only occur under the following circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) in writing, if a copy of the writing is promptly delivered to opposing counsel;</p>

  <p>(2) orally, upon adequate notice to opposing counsel; or</p>

  <p>(3) in the course of official proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-43--dealing-with-unrepresented-person">Rule 4.3 — Dealing With Unrepresented Person</h1>

<p>In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not:</p>

<p>(1)	give legal advice to the person, other than the advice to secure counsel, if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of the client; and</p>

<p>(2)	state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer’s role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding.</p>

<h1 id="rule-44--respect-for-rights-of-third-persons">Rule 4.4 — Respect for Rights of Third Persons</h1>

<p>(a) In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer who receives a writing relating to the representation of the lawyer’s client and knows or reasonably should know that the writing was inadvertently sent shall promptly notify the sender.</p>
