<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-61--voluntary-pro-bono-publico-service">Rule 6.1 — Voluntary Pro Bono Publico Service</h1>

<p>Every lawyer has a professional responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to pay. A lawyer should aspire to render at least 50 hours of pro bono publico legal services per year. In fulfilling this responsibility, the lawyer should:</p>

<p>(a)	provide a substantial majority of the 50 hours of legal services without fee or expectation of fee to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) persons of limited means;</p>

  <p>(2) charitable, religious, civic, community, governmental and educational organizations in matters that are designed primarily to address the needs of persons of limited means; or</p>

  <p>(3) individuals, groups or organizations seeking to secure or protect civil rights, civil liberties or public rights, or charitable, religious, civic, community, governmental and educational organizations in matters in furtherance of their organizational purposes, where the payment of standard legal fees would significantly deplete the organization’s economic resources or would be otherwise inappropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b)	provide any additional services through:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the delivery of legal services described in Paragraph (a) at a substantially reduced fee; or</p>

  <p>(2) participation in activities for improving the law, the legal system or the legal profession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, a lawyer should voluntarily contribute financial support to organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.</p>

<h1 id="rule-62--reserved">Rule 6.2 — Reserved</h1>

<h1 id="rule-63--membership-in-legal-services-organizations">Rule 6.3 — Membership in Legal Services Organizations</h1>

<p>A lawyer may serve as a director, officer or member of a legal services organization, apart from the law firm in which the lawyer practices, notwithstanding that the organization serves persons having interests adverse to a client of the lawyer. The lawyer shall not knowingly participate in a decision or action of the organization:</p>

<p>(1)	if participating in the decision or action would be incompatible with the lawyer’s obligations to a client under Rule 1.7; or</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>(2)	where the decision or action could have a material adverse effect on the representation of a client of the organization whose interests are adverse to a client of the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-64--law-reform-activities-affecting-client-interests">Rule 6.4 — Law Reform Activities Affecting Client Interests</h1>

<p>A lawyer may serve as a director, officer or member of an organization involved in reform of the law or its administration notwithstanding that the reform may affect the interests of a client of the lawyer. When the lawyer knows that the interests of a client may be materially benefited by a decision in which the lawyer participates, the lawyer shall disclose that fact but need not identify the client.</p>

<h1 id="rule-65--limited-legal-services-programs">Rule 6.5 — Limited Legal Services Programs</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer who, under the auspices of a program sponsored by a nonprofit organization or court, provides short-term limited legal services to a client without expectation by either the lawyer or the client that the lawyer will provide continuing representation in the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) is subject to Rules 1.7 and 1.9(a) only if the lawyer knows that the representation of the client involves a conflict of interest; and</p>

  <p>(2) is subject to Rule 1.10 only if the lawyer knows that another lawyer associated with the lawyer in a law firm is disqualified by Rule 1.7 or 1.9(a) with respect to the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2), Rule 1.10 is inapplicable to a representation governed by this Rule.</p>

<h1 id="rule-66--action-as-a-public-official">Rule 6.6 — Action as a Public Official</h1>

<p>A lawyer who holds public office shall not:</p>

<p>(a)	use his or her public position to obtain, or attempt to obtain, a special advantage in legislative matters for himself or herself or for a client under circumstances where the lawyer knows, or it is obvious, that such action is not in the public interest;</p>

<p>(b)	use his or her public position to influence, or attempt to influence, a tribunal to act in favor of himself or herself or his or her client; or</p>

<p>(c)	accept anything of value from any person when the lawyer knows or it is obvious that the offer is for the purpose of influencing the lawyer’s action as a public official.</p>
