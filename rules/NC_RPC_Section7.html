<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-71--communications-concerning-a-lawyers-services">Rule 7.1	— Communications Concerning a Lawyer’s Services</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services. A communication is false or misleading if it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading;</p>

  <p>(2) is likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve, or states or implies that the lawyer can achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; or</p>

  <p>(3) compares the lawyer’s services with other lawyers’ services, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A communication by a lawyer that contains a dramatization depicting a fictional situation is misleading unless it complies with paragraph (a) above and contains a conspicuous written or oral statement, at the beginning and the end of the communication, explaining that the communication contains a dramatization and does not depict actual events or real persons.</p>

<h1 id="rule-72--advertising">Rule 7.2	— Advertising</h1>

<p>(a) Subject to the requirements of Rules 7.1 and 7.3, a lawyer may advertise services through written, recorded or electronic communication, including public media.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer’s services except that a lawyer may</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) pay the reasonable costs of advertisements or communications permitted by this Rule;</p>

  <p>(2) pay the usual charges of a not-for-profit lawyer referral service that complies with Rule 7.2(d), or a prepaid or group legal services plan that complies with Rule 7.3(d); and</p>

  <p>(3) pay for a law practice in accordance with Rule 1.17.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) Any communication made pursuant to this rule, other than that of a lawyer referral service as described in paragraph (d), shall include the name and office address of at least one lawyer or law firm responsible for its content.</p>

<p>(d) A lawyer may participate in a lawyer referral service subject to the following conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the lawyer is professionally responsible for its operation including the use of a false, deceptive, or misleading name by the referral service;</p>

  <p>(2) the referral service is not operated for a profit;</p>

  <p>(3) the lawyer may pay to the lawyer referral service only a reasonable sum which represents a proportionate share of the referral service’s administrative and advertising costs;</p>

  <p>(4) the lawyer does not directly or indirectly receive anything of value other than legal fees earned from representation of clients referred by the service;</p>

  <p>(5) employees of the referral service do not initiate contact with prospective clients and do not engage in live telephone or in-person solicitation of clients;</p>

  <p>(6) the referral service does not collect any sums from clients or potential clients for use of the service; and</p>

  <p>(7) all advertisements by the lawyer referral service shall:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(A)	state that a list of all participating lawyers will be mailed free of charge to members of the public upon request and state where such information may be obtained; and</p>

    <p>(B)	explain the method by which the needs of the prospective client are matched with the qualifications of the recommended lawyer.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-73--direct-contact-with-potential-clients">Rule 7.3	— Direct Contact With Potential Clients</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone, or real-time electronic contact solicit professional employment when a significant motive for the lawyer’s doing so is the lawyer’s pecuniary gain, unless the person contacted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) is a lawyer; or</p>

  <p>(2) has a family, close personal, or prior professional relationship with the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall not solicit professional employment from a potential client by written, recorded or electronic communication or by in-person, telephone or real-time electronic contact even when not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a), if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the target of the solicitation has made known to the lawyer a desire not to be solicited by the lawyer; or</p>

  <p>(2) the solicitation involves coercion, duress, harassment, compulsion, intimidation, or threats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) Targeted Communications. Unless the recipient of the communication is a person specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2), every written, recorded, or electronic communication from a lawyer soliciting professional employment from anyone known to be in need of legal services in a particular matter shall include the statement, in capital letters, “THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR LEGAL SERVICES” (the advertising notice), which shall be conspicuous and subject to the following requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Written Communications. Written communications shall be mailed in an envelope. The advertising notice shall be printed on the front of the envelope, in a font that is as large as any other printing on the front or the back of the envelope. If more than one color or type of font is used on the front or the back of the envelope, the font used for the advertising notice shall match in color, type, and size the largest and widest of the fonts. The front of the envelope shall contain no printing other than the name of the lawyer or law firm and return address, the name and address of the recipient, and the advertising notice. The advertising notice shall also be printed at the beginning of the body of the enclosed written communication in a font as large as or larger than any other printing contained in the enclosed written communication. If more than one color or type of font is used on the enclosed written communication, then the font of the advertising notice shall match in color, type, and size the largest and widest of the fonts. Nothing on the envelope or the enclosed written communication shall be more conspicuous than the advertising notice.</p>

  <p>(2) Electronic Communications. The advertising notice shall appear in the “in reference” or subject box of the address or header section of the communication. No other statement shall appear in this block. The advertising notice shall also appear, at the beginning and ending of the electronic communication, in a font as large as or larger than any other printing in the body of the communication or in any masthead on the communication. If more than one color or type of font is used in the electronic communication, then the font of the advertising notice shall match in color, type, and size the largest and widest of the fonts. Nothing in the electronic communication shall be more conspicuous than the advertising notice.</p>

  <p>(3) Recorded Communications. The advertising notice shall be clearly articulated at the beginning and ending of the recorded communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions in paragraph (a), a lawyer may participate with a prepaid or group legal service plan subject to the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Definition. A prepaid legal services plan or a group legal services plan (“a plan”) is any arrangement by which a person, firm, or corporation, not otherwise authorized to engage in the practice of law, in exchange for any valuable consideration, offers to provide or arranges the provision of legal services that are paid for in advance of any immediate need for the specified legal service (“covered services”). In addition to covered services, a plan may provide specified legal services at fees that are less than what a non-member of the plan would normally pay. The North Carolina legal services offered by a plan must be provided by a licensed lawyer who is not an employee, director or owner of the plan. A prepaid legal services plan does not include the sale of an identified, limited legal service, such as drafting a will, for a fixed, one-time fee.</p>

  <p>(2) Conditions for Participation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(A)	The plan must be operated by an organization that is not owned or directed by the lawyer;</p>

    <p>(B)	The plan must be registered with the North Carolina State Bar and comply with all applicable rules regarding such plans;</p>

    <p>(C)	The lawyer must notify the State Bar in writing before participating in a plan and must notify the State Bar no later than 30 days after the lawyer discontinues participation in the plan;</p>

    <p>(D)	After reasonable investigation, the lawyer must have a good faith belief that the plan is being operated in compliance with the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct and other pertinent rules of the State Bar;</p>

    <p>(E)	All advertisements by the plan representing that it is registered with the State Bar shall also explain that registration does not constitute approval by the State Bar; and
(F) Notwithstanding the prohibitions in paragraph (a), the plan may use in-person or telephone contact to solicit memberships or subscriptions provided:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>(i) The solicited person is not known to need legal services in a particular matter covered by the plan; and</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(ii) The contact does not involve coercion, duress, or harassment and the communication with the solicited person is not false, deceptive or misleading.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-74--communication-of-fields-of-practice-and-specialization">Rule 7.4	— Communication of Fields of Practice and Specialization</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer may communicate the fact that the lawyer does or does not practice in particular fields of law.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is certified as a specialist in a field of practice unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the certification was granted by the North Carolina State Bar;</p>

  <p>(2) the certification was granted by an organization that is accredited by the North Carolina State Bar; or</p>

  <p>(3) the certification was granted by an organization that is accredited by the American Bar Association under procedures and criteria endorsed by the North Carolina State Bar; and</p>

  <p>(4) the name of the certifying organization is clearly identified in the communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-75--firm-names-and-letterheads">Rule 7.5	— Firm Names and Letterheads</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not use a firm name, letterhead, or other professional designation that violates Rule 7.1. A trade name may be used by a lawyer in private practice if it does not imply a connection with a government agency or with a public or charitable legal services organization and is not false or misleading in violation of Rule 7.1. Every trade name used by a law firm shall be registered with the North Carolina State Bar for a determination of whether the name is misleading.</p>

<p>(b) A law firm with offices in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located.</p>

<p>(c) A law firm maintaining offices only in North Carolina may not list any person not licensed to practice law in North Carolina as a lawyer affiliated with the firm unless the listing properly identifies the jurisdiction in which the lawyer is licensed and states that the lawyer is not licensed in North Carolina.</p>

<p>(d) The name of a lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any substantial period in which the lawyer is not actively and regularly practicing with the firm, whether or not the lawyer is precluded from practicing law.</p>

<p>(e) Lawyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other professional organization only when that is the fact.</p>
