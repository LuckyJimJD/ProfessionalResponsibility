			</div>


<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-11--competence">Rule 1.1 — Competence</h1>

<p>A lawyer shall not handle a legal matter that the lawyer knows or should know he or she is not competent to handle without associating with a lawyer who is competent to handle the matter. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p>

<h1 id="rule-12--scope-of-representation-and-allocation-of-authority-between-client-and-lawyer">Rule 1.2 — Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer</h1>

<p>(a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and, as required by Rule 1.4, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) A lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision whether to settle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client’s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.</p>

  <p>(2) A lawyer does not violate this rule by acceding to reasonable requests of opposing counsel that do not prejudice the rights of a client, by being punctual in fulfilling all professional commitments, by avoiding offensive tactics, or by treating with courtesy and consideration all persons involved in the legal process.</p>

  <p>(3) In the representation of a client, a lawyer may exercise his or her professional judgment to waive or fail to assert a right or position of the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A lawyer’s representation of a client, including representation by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client’s political, economic, social or moral views or activities.</p>

<p>(c) A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>(d) A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law.</p>

<h1 id="rule-13--diligence">Rule 1.3 — Diligence</h1>

<p>A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p>

<h1 id="rule-14--communication">Rule 1.4 — Communication</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client’s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client’s objectives are to be accomplished;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(5) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer’s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>

<h1 id="rule-15--fees">Rule 1.5 — Fees</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee or charge or collect a clearly excessive amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining whether a fee is clearly excessive include the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.</p>

<p>(c) A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by paragraph (d) or other law. A contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing signed by the client and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal; litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery; and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. The agreement must clearly notify the client of any expenses for which the client will be liable whether or not the client is the prevailing party. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.</p>

<p>(d) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case; however, a lawyer may charge and collect a contingent fee for representation in a criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceeding if not otherwise prohibited by law; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) a contingent fee in a civil case in which such a fee is prohibited by law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(e) A division of a fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) the client agrees to the arrangement, including the share each lawyer will receive, and the agreement is confirmed in writing; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) the total fee is reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(f) Any lawyer having a dispute with a client regarding a fee for legal services must:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) make reasonable efforts to advise his or her client of the existence of the North Carolina State Bar’s program of fee dispute resolution at least 30 days prior to initiating legal proceedings to collect the disputed fee; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) participate in good faith in the fee dispute resolution process if the client submits a proper request.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-16--confidentiality-of-information">Rule 1.6 — Confidentiality of Information</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information acquired during the professional relationship with a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer may reveal information protected from disclosure by paragraph (a) to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct, the law or court order;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) to prevent the commission of a crime by the client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) to prevent reasonably certain death or bodily harm;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) to prevent, mitigate, or rectify the consequences of a client’s criminal or fraudulent act in the commission of which the lawyer’s services were used;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(5) to secure legal advice about the lawyer’s compliance with these Rules;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(6) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client; to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved; or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer’s representation of the client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(7) to comply with the rules of a lawyers’ or judges’ assistance program approved by the North Carolina State Bar or the North Carolina Supreme Court; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(8) to detect and resolve conflicts of interest arising from the lawyer’s change of employment or from changes in the composition or ownership of a firm, but only if the revealed information would not compromise the attorney-client privilege or otherwise prejudice the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client.</p>

<p>(d) The duty of confidentiality described in this Rule encompasses information received by a lawyer then acting as an agent of a lawyers’ or judges’ assistance program approved by the North Carolina State Bar or the North Carolina Supreme Court regarding another lawyer or judge seeking assistance or to whom assistance is being offered. For the purposes of this Rule, “client” refers to lawyers seeking assistance from lawyers’ or judges’ assistance programs approved by the North Carolina State Bar or the North Carolina Supreme Court.</p>

<h1 id="rule-17--conflict-of-interrest-current-clients">Rule 1.7 — Conflict of Interrest: Current Clients</h1>

<p>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) the representation of one or more clients may be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client, a former client, or a third person, or by a personal interest of the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) the representation is not prohibited by law;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-18--conflict-of-interest-current-clients-specific-rules">Rule 1.8 — Conflict of Interest: Current Clients: Specific Rules</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest directly adverse to a client unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer’s role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the transaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall not use information relating to representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client gives informed consent, except as permitted or required by these Rules.</p>

<p>(c) A lawyer shall not solicit any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, or prepare on behalf of a client an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer any substantial gift unless the lawyer or other recipient of the gift is related to the client. For purposes of this paragraph, related persons include a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or other relative or individual with whom the lawyer or the client maintains a close, familial relationship.</p>

<p>(d) Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.</p>

<p>(e) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) a lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) a lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(f) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the client gives informed consent;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) there is no interference with the lawyer’s independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 1.6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(g) A lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients, or in a criminal case an aggregated agreement as to guilty or nolo contendere pleas, unless each client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client. The lawyer’s disclosure shall include the existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.</p>

<p>(h) A lawyer shall not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer’s liability to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making the agreement; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) settle a claim or potential claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client unless that person is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel in connection therewith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(i) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer’s fee or expenses, provided the requirements of Rule 1.8(a) are satisfied; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case, except as prohibited by Rule 1.5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While lawyers are associated in a firm, a prohibition in the foregoing paragraphs (a) through (i), that applies to any one of them shall apply to all of them.</p>

<h1 id="rule-19--duties-to-former-clients">Rule 1.9 — Duties to Former Clients</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall not knowingly represent a person in the same or a substantially related matter in which a firm with which the lawyer formerly was associated had previously represented a client</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) whose interests are materially adverse to that person; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the matter;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>

<p>(c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) reveal information relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-110--imputation-of-conflicts-of-interest-general-rule">Rule 1.10 — Imputation of Conflicts of Interest: General Rule</h1>

<p>(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer, including a prohibition under Rule 6.6, and the prohibition does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm.</p>

<p>(b) When a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm is not prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests materially adverse to those of a client represented by the formerly associated lawyer and not currently represented by the firm, unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the matter is the same or substantially related to that in which the formerly associated lawyer represented the client; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) any lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) When a lawyer becomes associated with a firm, no lawyer associated in the firm shall knowingly represent a person in a matter in which that lawyer is disqualified under Rule 1.9 unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the personally disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) written notice is promptly given to any affected former client to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(d) A disqualification prescribed by this rule may be waived by the affected client under the conditions stated in Rule 1.7.</p>

<p>(e) The disqualification of lawyers associated in a firm with former or current government lawyers is governed by Rule 1.11.</p>

<h1 id="rule-111--special-conflicts-of-interest-for-former-and-current-government-officers-and-employees">Rule 1.11 — Special Conflicts of Interest for Former and Current Government Officers and Employees</h1>

<p>(a) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer who has formerly served as a public officer or employee of the government:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) is subject to Rule 1.9(c); and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) shall not otherwise represent a client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing, to the representation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) When a lawyer is disqualified from representation under paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer having information that the lawyer knows is confidential government information about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee, may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the material disadvantage of that person. As used in this Rule, the term “confidential government information” means information that has been obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this Rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and which is not otherwise available to the public. A firm with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter.</p>

<p>(d) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer currently serving as a public officer or employee:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) is subject to Rules 1.7 and 1.9; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) shall not:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(A)	participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice or nongovernmental employment, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing; or</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(B)	negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved as a party or as lawyer for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially, except that a lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge, other adjudicative officer or arbitrator may negotiate for private employment as permitted by Rule 1.12(b) and subject to the conditions stated in Rule 1.12(b).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(e) As used in this Rule, the term “matter” includes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, investigation, charge, accusation, arrest or other particular matter involving a specific party or parties, and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) any other matter covered by the conflict of interest rules of the appropriate government agency.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="rule-112--former-judge-arbitrator-mediator-or-other-third-party-neutral">Rule 1.12 — Former Judge, Arbitrator, Mediator or Other Third-Party Neutral</h1>

<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (d), a lawyer shall not represent anyone in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer or law clerk to such a person or as an arbitrator, mediator or other third-party neutral, unless all parties to the proceeding give informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer shall not negotiate for employment with any person who is involved as a party or as lawyer for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer or as an arbitrator, mediator or other third-party neutral. A lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge or other adjudicative officer may negotiate for employment with a party or lawyer involved in a matter in which the clerk is participating personally and substantially, but only after the lawyer has notified the judge or other adjudicative officer.</p>

<p>(c) If a lawyer is disqualified by paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in the matter unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) written notice is promptly given to the parties and any appropriate tribunal to enable them to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(d) An arbitrator selected as a partisan of a party in a multimember arbitration panel is not prohibited from subsequently representing that party.</p>

<h1 id="rule-113--organization-as-client">Rule 1.13 — Organization as Client</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.</p>

<p>(b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee. or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to act or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the organization, or a violation of law which reasonably might be imputed to the organization, and is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the organization. Unless the lawyer reasonably believes that it is not necessary in the best interest of the organization to do so, the lawyer shall refer the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the circumstances, to the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.</p>

<p>(c) If, despite the lawyer’s efforts in accordance with paragraph (b), the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists upon action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law and is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, the lawyer may reveal such information outside the organization to the extent permitted by Rule 1.6 and may resign in accordance with Rule 1.16.</p>

<p>(d) Paragraph (c) shall not apply with respect to information relating to a lawyer’s representation of an organization to investigate an alleged violation of law, or to defend the organization or an officer, employee, or other constituent associated with the organization against a claim arising out of an alleged violation of law.</p>

<p>(e) A lawyer who reasonably believes that he or she has been discharged because of the lawyer’s actions taken pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c), or who withdraws under circumstances that require or permit the lawyer to take action under these Rules, shall proceed as the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to assure that the organization’s highest authority is informed of the lawyer’s discharge or withdrawal.</p>

<p>(f) In dealing with an organization’s directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the identity of the client when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the organization’s interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.</p>

<p>(g) A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, subject to the provisions of Rule 1.7. If the organization’s consent to the dual representation is required by Rule 1.7, the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders.</p>

<h1 id="rule-114--client-with-diminished-capacity">Rule 1.14 — Client With Diminished Capacity</h1>

<p>(a) When a client’s capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with a representation is diminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.</p>

<p>(b) When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action, including consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem or guardian.</p>

<p>(c) Information relating to the representation of a client with diminished capacity is protected by Rule 1.6. When taking protective action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is impliedly authorized under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client’s interests.</p>

<p>[ * * * ]</p>

<h1 id="rule-115-2--general-rules">Rule 1.15-2 — General Rules</h1>

<p>(a) Entrusted Property. All entrusted property shall be identified, held, and maintained separate from the property of the lawyer, and shall be deposited, disbursed, and distributed only in accordance with this Rule 1.15.</p>

<p>(b) Deposit of Trust Funds. All trust funds received by or placed under the control of a lawyer shall be promptly deposited in either a general trust account or a dedicated trust account of the lawyer. Trust funds placed in a general account are those which, in the lawyer’s good faith judgment, are nominal or short-term. General trust accounts are to be administered in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct and the provisions of 27 NCAC Chapter 1, Subchapter D, Sections .1300.</p>

<p>(c) Deposit of Fiduciary Funds. All fiduciary funds received by or placed under the control of a lawyer shall be promptly deposited in a fiduciary account or a general trust account of the lawyer.</p>

<p>(d) Safekeeping of Other Entrusted Property. A lawyer may also hold entrusted property other than fiduciary funds (such as securities) in a fiduciary account. All entrusted property received by a lawyer that is not deposited in a trust account or fiduciary account (such as a stock certificate) shall be promptly identified, labeled as property of the person or entity for whom it is to be held, and placed in a safe deposit box or other suitable place of safekeeping. The lawyer shall disclose the location of the property to the client or other person for whom it is held. Any safe deposit box or other place of safekeeping shall be located in this state, unless the lawyer has been otherwise authorized in writing by the client or other person for whom it is held.</p>

<p>[ * * * ]</p>

<p>(f) Funds in Accounts. A trust or fiduciary account may only hold entrusted property. Third party funds that are not received by or placed under the control of the lawyer in connection with the performance of legal services or professional fiduciary services may not be deposited or maintained in a trust or fiduciary account. Additionally, no funds belonging to a the lawyer shall be deposited or maintained in a trust account or fiduciary account of the lawyer except:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) funds sufficient to open or maintain an account, pay any bank service charges, or pay any tax levied on the account; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) funds belonging in part to a client or other third party and in part currently or conditionally to the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(g) Mixed Funds Deposited Intact. When funds belonging to the lawyer are received in combination with funds belonging to the client or other persons, all of the funds shall be deposited intact. The amounts currently or conditionally belonging to the lawyer shall be identified on the deposit slip or other record. After the deposit has been finally credited to the account, the lawyer shall withdraw the amounts to which the lawyer is or becomes entitled. If the lawyer’s entitlement is disputed, the disputed amounts shall remain in the trust account or fiduciary account until the dispute is resolved.</p>

<p>(h) Items Payable to Lawyer. Any item drawn on a trust account or fiduciary account for the payment of the lawyer’s fees or expenses shall be made payable to the lawyer and shall indicate on the item by client name, file number, or other identifying information the client from whose balance the item is drawn. Any item that does not include this information may not be used to withdraw funds from a trust account or a fiduciary account for payment of the lawyer’s fees or expenses.</p>

<p>[ * * * ]</p>

<p>(j) Debit Cards Prohibited. Use of a debit card to withdraw funds from a general or dedicated trust account or a fiduciary account is prohibited.</p>

<p>[ * * * ]</p>

<p>(n) Delivery of Client Property. A lawyer shall promptly pay or deliver to the client, or to third persons as directed by the client, any entrusted property belonging to the client and to which the client is currently entitled.</p>

<p>(o) Property Received as Security. Any entrusted property or document of title delivered to a lawyer as security for the payment of a fee or other obligation to the lawyer shall be held in trust in accordance with this Rule 1.15 and shall be clearly identified as property held as security and not as a completed transfer of beneficial ownership to the lawyer. This provision does not apply to property received by a lawyer on account of fees or other amounts owed to the lawyer at the time of receipt; however, such transfers are subject to the rules governing legal fees or business transactions between a lawyer and client.</p>

<p>(p) Duty to Report Misappropriation. A lawyer who discovers or reasonably believes that entrusted property has been misappropriated or misapplied shall promptly inform the Trust Account Compliance Counsel (TACC) in the North Carolina State Bar Office of Counsel. Discovery of intentional theft or fraud must be reported to the TACC immediately. When an accounting or bank error results in an unintentional and inadvertent use of one client’s trust funds to pay the obligations of another client, the event must be reported unless the misapplication is discovered and rectified on or before the next quarterly reconciliation required by Rule 1.15-3(d)(1). This rule requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6 if necessary to report the misappropriation or misapplication.</p>

<p>(q) Interest on Deposited Funds. Under no circumstances shall the lawyer be entitled to any interest earned on funds deposited in a trust account or fiduciary account. Except as authorized by Rule .1316 of subchapter 1D of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar, any interest earned on a trust account or fiduciary account, less any amounts deducted for bank service charges and taxes, shall belong to the client or other person or entity entitled to the corresponding principal amount.</p>

<p>(r) Abandoned Property. If entrusted property is unclaimed, the lawyer shall make due inquiry of his or her personnel, records and other sources of information in an effort to determine the identity and location of the owner of the property. If that effort is successful, the entrusted property shall be promptly transferred to the person or entity to whom it belongs. If the effort is unsuccessful and the provisions of G.S. 116B-53 are satisfied, the property shall be deemed abandoned, and the lawyer shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 116B of the General Statutes concerning the escheat of abandoned property.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(5) the client has used the lawyer’s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(6) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer’s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(7) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(8) the client insists upon presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(9) other good cause for withdrawal exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.</p>

<p>(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client’s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</p>

<h1 id="rule-117--sale-of-a-law-practice">Rule 1.17 — Sale of a Law Practice</h1>

<p>A lawyer or a law firm may sell or purchase a law practice, or an area of law practice, including good will, if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<p>(a) The seller ceases to engage in the private practice of law, or in the area of practice that has been sold, from an office that is within a one-hundred (100) mile radius of the purchased law practice, except the seller may continue to practice law with the purchaser and may provide legal representation at no charge to indigent persons or to members of the seller’s family;</p>

<p>(b) The entire practice, or the entire area of practice, is sold to one or more lawyers or law firms;</p>

  <p>(1) the proposed sale, including the identity of the purchaser;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) the client’s right to retain other counsel and to take possession of the client’s files prior to the sale or at any time thereafter; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) the fact that the client’s consent to the transfer of the client’s files and legal representation to the purchaser will be presumed if the client does not take any action or does not otherwise object within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(d) If the seller or the purchaser identifies a conflict of interest that prohibits the purchaser from representing the client, the seller’s notice to the client shall advise the client to retain substitute counsel.</p>

<p>(e) If a client cannot be given notice, the representation of that client may be transferred to the purchaser only upon entry of an order so authorizing by a court having jurisdiction. The seller may disclose to the court in camera information relating to the representation only to the extent necessary to obtain an order authorizing the transfer of a file. In the event the court fails to grant a substitution of counsel in a matter, that matter shall not be included in the sale and the sale otherwise shall be unaffected.</p>

<p>(f) The fees charged clients shall not be increased by reason of the sale.</p>

<p>(g) The seller and purchaser may agree that the purchaser does not have to pay the entire sales price for the seller’s law practice in one lump sum.

The seller, however, shall have no say regarding the purchaser’s conduct of the law practice.</p>

<h1 id="rule-118--duties-to-prospective-client">Rule 1.18 — Duties to Prospective Client</h1>

<p>(a) A person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.</p>

<p>(b) Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has learned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal that information, except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.</p>

<p>(c) A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).</p>

<p>(d) Representation is permissible if both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing, or:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.</p>
</blockquote>
