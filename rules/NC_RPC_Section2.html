<div class="statute">
	<h1 id="rule-21--advisor">Rule 2.1 — Advisor</h1>

<p>In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent, professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law, but also to other considerations such as moral, economic, social, and political factors that may be relevant to the client’s situation.</p>

<h1 id="rule-22--reserved">Rule 2.2 — Reserved</h1>

<h1 id="rule-23--evaluation-for-use-by-third-persons">Rule 2.3 — Evaluation for Use by Third Persons</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer may undertake an evaluation of a matter affecting a client for the use of someone other than the client if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that making the evaluation is compatible with other aspects of the lawyer’s relationship with the client; and</p>

  <p>(2) the client so requests or the client consents after consultation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Except as disclosure is required in connection with a report of an evaluation, information relating to the evaluation is otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</p>

<h1 id="rule-24--lawyer-serving-as-third-party-neutral">Rule 2.4 — Lawyer Serving as Third-Party Neutral</h1>

<p>(a) A lawyer serves as a third-party neutral when the lawyer assists two or more persons who are not clients of the lawyer to reach a resolution of a dispute or other matter that has arisen between them. Service as a third-party neutral may include service as an arbitrator, a mediator or in such other capacity as will enable the lawyer to assist the parties to resolve the matter.</p>

<p>(b) A lawyer serving as a third-party neutral shall inform unrepresented parties that the lawyer is not representing them. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a party does not understand the lawyer’s role in the matter, the lawyer shall explain the difference between the lawyer’s role as a third-party neutral and a lawyer’s role as one who represents a client.</p>
