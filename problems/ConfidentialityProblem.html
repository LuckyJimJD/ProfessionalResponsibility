<p>You are a public defender representing Jerry Cashwell, who has been charged with murder. Based on witness statements, the police and prosecutor believe that another man, Lee Hunt, planned the murder and that Cashwell acted as Hunt’s accomplice in carrying out the killing. To avoid any potential conflict, the court has appointed another lawyer to represent Hunt.</p>

<p>During your initial meeting with Cashwell, he tells you, “I killed that guy all on my own. Hunt didn’t have anything to do with it.” Based on the details that Cashwell provides about the crime, and the lack of any apparent motive to falsely claim sole responsibility, you conclude that Cashwell is telling the truth.</p>

<p><em>What are your obligations under Rule 1.6(a)? Do any of the exceptions under Rule 1.6(b) apply at this point?</em></p>

<p>Cashwell and Hunt are tried separately. At Hunt’s trial, he testifies that he had no role in the crime. Nevertheless, Hunt is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>

<p>Following Hunt’s conviction, you reach an agreement with the prosecution under which Cashwell will plead guilty to the murder charge and receive a life sentence. The prosecutor tells you they are offering this deal, “because we know Cashwell &amp; Hunt acted together”. You notify Cashwell of the plea offer and explain to him that, if he goes to trial and it comes out that he acted alone, he would likely face the death penalty. Cashwell accepts the deal and enters a guilty plea. At Cashwell’s allocution, he does not reveal that Hunt had no involvement.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any obligation to correct the prosecutor’s mistaken belief about Hunt’s involvement in the murder? Do you have any obligation to inform the court that Hunt was not involved?</em></p>

<p>About ten years later, Cashwell commits suicide in prison. Hunt remains in prison serving his life sentence.</p>

<p><em>Does MRPC Rule 1.6 permit you to reveal Cashwell’s admission of sole responsbility to Hunt’s attorney now that Cashwell is dead?</em></p>

<p><em>Does NC Rule 8.6 permit or require disclosure?</em></p>
