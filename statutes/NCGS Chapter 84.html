including administrative tribunals and other judicial or quasi-judicial bodies,

or give opinion upon the legal rights of any person, firm or corporation:
Provided, that the above reference to particular acts which are specifically
included within the definition of the phrase "practice law" shall not
be construed to limit the foregoing general definition of the term, but shall
be construed to include the foregoing particular acts, as well as all other
acts within the general definition.</p>

<p class="aMargin1">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase "practice law" does not
encompass:</p>

person or Web site provider. Nothing in this subdivision or in G.S.&nbsp;84-2.2
shall be construed to permit any person or Web site provider who is not licensed
to practice law in accordance with this Chapter to prepare for any third person
any contract or deed conveying any interest in real property, or to abstract or
pass upon title to any real property, which is located in this State.</p>

<p class="aBlock1">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The completion of or assisting a consumer in the
completion of various agreements, contracts, forms, and other documents related

vehicle, by a motor vehicle dealer licensed under Article 12 of Chapter 20 of
the General Statutes. <span class="cHistoryNote"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">&nbsp;(C.C.P.,

advice, as defined by G.S.&nbsp;84-2.1 does not include the operation of a Web

generates a legal document based on the consumer's answers to questions
presented by the software, provided that all of the following are satisfied:</p>

<p class="aBlock1">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consumer is provided a means to see the blank
template or the final, completed document before finalizing a purchase of that
document.</p>

North Carolina has reviewed each blank template offered to North Carolina
consumers, including each and every potential part thereof that may appear in

kept on file by the provider and provided to the consumer upon written request.</p>

<p class="aBlock1">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provider must communicate to the consumer that
the forms or templates are not a substitute for the advice or services of an
attorney.</p>

<p class="aBlock1">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provider discloses its legal name and physical location
and address to the consumer.</p>

<p class="aBlock1">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provider does not disclaim any warranties or
liability and does not limit the recovery of damages or other remedies by the
consumer.</p>

to jurisdiction or venue in any state other than North Carolina for the
resolution of disputes between the provider and the consumer.</p>

<p class="aBlock1">(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provider must have a consumer satisfaction
process. All consumer concerns involving the unauthorized practice of law made
to the provider shall be referred to the North Carolina State Bar. The consumer
satisfaction process must be conspicuously displayed on the provider's Web
site.</p>

<p class="aMargin1">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Web site provider subject to this section shall
register with the North Carolina State Bar prior to commencing operation in the
State and shall renew its registration with the State Bar annually. The State
Bar may not refuse registration.</p>

<p class="aMargin1">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Web site provider subject to this section

the applicant consenting to the check of the criminal record and to the use of
the fingerprints and other identifying information required by the State or
national repositories. The applicant's fingerprints shall be forwarded to the
State Bureau of Investigation for a search of the State's criminal history
