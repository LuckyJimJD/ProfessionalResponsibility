<p>b. No, unless at the time of the sale of Seller’s home, Seller agreed that Attorney would not subsequently be precluded from representing other clients against Seller</p>

<p>c. Yes, because the partnership dissolution is unrelated to the sale of Seller’s home</p>

<p>d. Yes, unless Seller sold the home while in the partnership with Partner.</p>

  <li>What if A’s case is before the NC Court of Appeals, and XYZ’s case is before the Virginia Supreme Court?</li>
