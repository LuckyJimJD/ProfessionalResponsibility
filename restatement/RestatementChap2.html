	<h4 id="introductory-note">Introductory Note</h4>

<p>The subject of this Chapter is, from one point of view, derived from the law of agency. It concerns a voluntary arrangement in which an agent, a lawyer, agrees to work for the benefit of a principal, a client. A lawyer is an agent, to whom clients entrust matters, property, and information, which may be of great importance and sensitivity, and whose work is usually not subject to detailed client supervision because of its complexity. Because those characteristics of the client-lawyer relationship make clients vulnerable to harm, and because of the importance to the legal system of faithful representation, the law stated in this Chapter provides a number of safeguards for clients beyond those generally provided to principals. The client-lawyer relationship normally comes into existence only if the client consents, and the client may end it at any time. The lawyer is subject to duties of care, loyalty, confidentiality, and communication, duties enforceable by the client and through disciplinary sanctions. The client also retains considerable authority to control the lawyer, although practical considerations often inhibit the use of that authority. The law also limits client authority for the protection of third persons dealing with the lawyer and for the convenience of the judicial system.</p>

<h2 id="-14-formation-of-a-client-lawyer-relationship">§ 14. Formation of a Client-Lawyer Relationship</h2>

<p>A relationship of client and lawyer arises when:</p>

<p>(1) a person manifests to a lawyer the person’s intent that the lawyer provide legal services for the person; and either</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the lawyer manifests to the person consent to do so; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer fails to manifest lack of consent to do so, and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide the services; or</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2) a tribunal with power to do so appoints the lawyer to provide the services.</p>

The lawyer’s consent or failure to object. Like a client, a lawyer may manifest consent to creating a client-lawyer relationship in many ways. The lawyer may explicitly agree to represent the client or may indicate consent by action, for example by performing services requested by the client. An agent for the lawyer may communicate consent, for example, a secretary or paralegal with express, implied, or apparent authority to act for the lawyer in undertaking a representation.</h6>

The lawyer’s consent may sometimes precede the client’s manifestation of intent, for example when an insurer designates a lawyer to represent an insured (see § 134, Comment f) who then accepts the representation. Although this Section treats separately the required communications of the client and the lawyer, the acts of each often illuminate those of the other.</h6>

Client telephones Lawyer, who has previously represented Client, stating that Client wishes Lawyer to handle a pending antitrust investigation and asking Lawyer to come to Client’s headquarters to explore the appropriate strategy for Client to follow. Lawyer comes to the headquarters and spends a day discussing strategy, without stating then or promptly thereafter that Lawyer has not yet decided whether to represent Client. Lawyer has communicated willingness to represent Client by so doing. Had Client simply asked Lawyer to discuss the possibility of representing Client, no client-lawyer relationship would result.</h6>

As part of a bar-association peer-support program, lawyer A consults lawyer B in confidence about an issue relating to lawyer A’s representation of a client. This does not create a client-lawyer relationship between A’s client and B. Whether a client-lawyer relationship exists between A and B depends on the foregoing and additional circumstances, including the nature of the program, the subject matter of the consultation, and the nature of prior dealings, if any, between them.</h6>

In many such instances, the lawyer’s conduct constitutes implied assent. In others, the lawyer’s duty arises from the principle of promissory estoppel, under which promises inducing reasonable reliance may be enforced to avoid injustice (see Restatement Second, Contracts § 90). In appraising whether the person’s reliance was reasonable, courts consider that lawyers ordinarily have superior knowledge of what representation entails and that lawyers often encourage clients and potential clients to rely on them. The rules governing when a lawyer may withdraw from a representation (see § 32) apply to representations arising from implied assent or promissory estoppel.</h6>

Claimant writes to Lawyer, describing a medical-malpractice suit that Claimant wishes to bring and asking Lawyer to represent Claimant. Lawyer does not answer the letter. A year later, the statute of limitations applicable to the suit expires. Claimant then sues Lawyer for legal malpractice for not having filed the suit on time. Under this Section no client-lawyer relationship was created (see § 50, Comment c). Lawyer did not communicate willingness to represent Claimant, and Claimant could not reasonably have relied on Lawyer to do so. On a lawyer’s duty to a prospective client, see § 15.</h6>

Defendant telephones Lawyer’s office and tells Lawyer’s Secretary that Defendant would like Lawyer to represent Defendant in an automobile-violation proceeding set for hearing in 10 days, this being a type of proceeding that Defendant knows Lawyer regularly handles. Secretary tells Defendant to send in the papers concerning the proceeding, not telling Defendant that Lawyer would then decide whether to take the case, and Defendant delivers the papers the next day. Lawyer does not communicate with Defendant until the day before the hearing, when Lawyer tells Defendant that Lawyer does not wish to take the case. A trier of fact could find that a client-lawyer relationship came into existence when Lawyer failed to communicate that Lawyer was not representing Defendant. Defendant relied on Lawyer by not seeking other counsel when that was still practicable. Defendant’s reliance was reasonable because Lawyer regularly handled Defendant’s type of case, because Lawyer’s agent had responded to Defendant’s request for help by asking Defendant to transfer papers needed for the proceeding, and because the imminence of the hearing made it appropriate for Lawyer to inform Defendant and return the papers promptly if Lawyer decided not to take the case.</h6>

Organizational, fiduciary, and class-action clients. When the client is a corporation or other organization, the organization’s structure and organic law determine whether a particular agent has authority to retain and direct the lawyer. Whether the lawyer is to represent the organization, a person or entity associated with it, or more than one such persons and entities is a question of fact to be determined based on reasonable expectations in the circumstances (see Subsection (1)). Where appropriate, due consideration should be given to the unreasonableness of a claimed expectation of entering into a co-client status when a significant and readily apparent conflict of interest exists between the organization or other client and the associated person or entity claimed to be a co-client (see § 131).</h6>

Hence, the lawyer must clarify whom the lawyer intends to represent when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that, contrary to the lawyer’s own intention, a person, individually, or agents of an entity, on behalf of the entity, reasonably rely on the lawyer to provide legal services to that person or entity (see Subsection (1)(b); see also § 103, Comment b (extent of a lawyer’s duty to warn an unrepresented person that the lawyer represents a client with conflicting interests)). Such clarification may be required, for example, with respect to an officer of an entity client such as a corporation, with respect to one or more partners in a client partnership or in the case of affiliated organizations such as a parent, subsidiary, or similar organization related to a client person or client entity. An implication that such a relationship exists is more likely to be found when the lawyer performs personal legal services for an individual as well or where the organization is small and characterized by extensive common ownership and management. But the lawyer does not enter into a client-lawyer relationship with a person associated with an organizational client solely because the person communicates with the lawyer on matters relevant to the organization that are also relevant to the personal situation of the person. In all events, the question is one of fact based on the reasonable and apparent expectations of the person or entity whose status as client is in question.</h6>

In the absence of clarification the inference to be drawn may depend on the circumstances and on the law of the jurisdiction. Similar issues may arise when a lawyer represents other fiduciaries with respect to their fiduciary responsibilities, for example a pension-fund trustee or another lawyer.</h6>

For many purposes, the named class representatives are the clients of the lawyer for the class. On conflict-of-interest issues, see § 125, Comment f. Yet class members who are not named representatives also have some characteristics of clients. For example, their confidential communications directly to the class lawyer may be privileged (compare § 70, Comment c), and opposing counsel may not be free to communicate with them directly (see § 99, Comment l).</h6>

Although class representatives must be approved by the court, they are often initially self-selected, selected by their lawyer, or even (when a plaintiff sues a class of defendants) selected by their adversary. Members of the class often lack the incentive or knowledge to monitor the performance of the class representatives. Although members may sometimes opt out of the class, they may have no practical alternative other than remaining in the class if they wish to enforce their rights. Lawyers in class actions thus have duties to the class as well as to the class representatives.</h6>

The lawyer may also propose that opposing positions within the class be separately represented, that sub-classes be created, or that other measures be taken to ensure broader class participation. Withdrawal may be an option (see § 32), but one that is often undesirable because it may leave the class without effective representation. The lawyer should act for the benefit of the class as its members would reasonably define that benefit.</h6>

<h2 id="-15-a-lawyers-duties-to-a-prospective-client">§ 15. A Lawyer’s Duties to a Prospective Client</h2>

<p>(1) When a person discusses with a lawyer the possibility of their forming a client-lawyer relationship for a matter and no such relationship ensues, the lawyer must:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) not subsequently use or disclose confidential information learned in the consultation, except to the extent permitted with respect to confidential information of a client or former client as stated in §§ 61-67;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) protect the person’s property in the lawyer’s custody as stated in §§ 44- 46; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) use reasonable care to the extent the lawyer provides the person legal services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2) A lawyer subject to Subsection (1) may not represent a client whose interests are materially adverse to those of a former prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter when the lawyer or another lawyer whose disqualification is imputed to the lawyer under §§ 123 and 124 has received from the prospective client confidential information that could be significantly harmful to the prospective client in the matter, except that such a representation is permissible if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) (i) any personally prohibited lawyer takes reasonable steps to avoid exposure to confidential information other than information appropriate to determine whether to represent the prospective client, and (ii) such lawyer is screened as stated in § 124(2)(b) and (c); or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) both the affected client and the prospective client give informed consent to the representation under the limitations and conditions provided in § 122.</p>

<p>(2) act with reasonable competence and diligence;</p>

<p>(3) comply with obligations concerning the client’s confidences and property, avoid</p>

<p>impermissible conflicting interests, deal honestly with the client, and not employ advantages arising from the client-lawyer relationship in a manner adverse to the client; and</p>

<p>(b) if the contract is made after the lawyer has finished providing services, the client may avoid it if the client was not informed of facts needed to evaluate the appropriateness of the lawyer’s compensation or other benefits conferred on the lawyer by the contract.</p>

Limiting a representation. Clients and lawyers may define in reasonable ways the services a lawyer is to provide (see § 16), for example to handle a trial but not any appeal, counsel a client on the tax aspects of a transaction but not other aspects, or advise a client about a representation in which the primary role has been entrusted to another lawyer. Such arrangements are not waivers of a client’s right to more extensive services but a definition of the services to be performed. They are therefore treated separately under many lawyer codes as contracts limiting the objectives of the representation. Clients ordinarily understand the implications and possible costs of such arrangements. The scope of many such representations requires no explanation or disclaimer of broader involvement.</h6>

Section 19(1) hence qualifies the power of client and lawyer to limit the representation. Taken together with requirements stated in other Sections, five safeguards apply.</h6>

For example, if the lawyer is to provide only tax advice, the client must be aware that the transaction may pose non-tax issues as well as being informed of any disadvantages involved in dividing the representation among several lawyers (see also §§ 15 &amp; 20).</h6>

When the client is sophisticated in such waivers, informed consent ordinarily permits the inference that the waiver is reasonable. For other clients, the requirement is met if, in addition to informed consent, the benefits supposedly obtained by the waiver—typically, a reduced legal fee or the ability to retain a particularly able lawyer—could reasonably be considered to outweigh the potential risk posed by the limitation. It is also relevant whether there were special circumstances warranting the limitation and whether it was the client or the lawyer who sought it. Also relevant is the choice available to clients; for example, if most local lawyers, but not lawyers in other communities, insist on the same limitation, client acceptance of the limitation is subject to special scrutiny.</h6>

For example, a client who seeks assistance on a matter on which the statute of limitations is about to run would not reasonably expect extensive investigation and research before the case must be filed. A lawyer may be asked to assist a client concerning an unfamiliar area because other counsel are unavailable. If the lawyer knows or should know that the lawyer lacks competence necessary for the representation, the lawyer must limit assistance to that which the lawyer believes reasonably necessary to deal with the situation.</h6>

<h1 id="topic-3-authority-to-make-decisions">Topic 3. Authority to Make Decisions</h1>

<h4 id="introductory-note-1">Introductory Note</h4>

<p>Traditionally, some lawyers considered that a client put affairs in the lawyer’s hands, who then managed them as the lawyer thought would best advance the client’s interests. So conducting the relationship can subordinate the client to the lawyer. The lawyer might not fully understand the client’s best interests or might consciously or unconsciously pursue the lawyer’s own interests. An opposite view of the client-lawyer relationship treats the lawyer as a servant of the client, who must do whatever the client wants limited only by the requirements of law. That view ignores the interest of the lawyer and of society that a lawyer practice responsibly and independently.</p>

<p>A middle view is that the client defines the goals of the representation and the lawyer implements them, but that each consults with the other. Except for certain matters reserved for client or lawyer to decide, the scope of the lawyer’s authority is itself one of the subjects for consultation, with room for the client’s wishes and the parties’ contracts to modify the traditionally broad delegation of authority to the lawyer. This approach, accepted in this Restatement, permits a variety of allocations of authority.</p>

<h2 id="-20-a-lawyers-duty-to-inform-and-consult-with-a-client">§ 20. A Lawyer’s Duty to Inform and Consult with a Client</h2>

<p>(1) A lawyer must keep a client reasonably informed about the matter and must consult with a client to a reasonable extent concerning decisions to be made by the lawyer under §§ 21-23.</p>

<p>(2) A lawyer must promptly comply with a client’s reasonable requests for information.</p>

<p>(3) A lawyer must notify a client of decisions to be made by the client under §§ 21-23 and must explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>

<h2 id="-21-allocating-the-authority-to-decide-between-a-client-and-a-lawyer">§ 21. Allocating the Authority to Decide Between a Client and a Lawyer</h2>

<p>As between client and lawyer:</p>

<p>(1) A client and lawyer may agree which of them will make specified decisions, subject to the requirements stated in §§ 18, 19, 22, 23, and other provisions of this Restatement. The agreement may be superseded by another valid agreement.</p>

<p>(2) A client may instruct a lawyer during the representation, subject to the requirements stated in §§ 22, 23, and other provisions of this Restatement.</p>

<p>(3) Subject to Subsections (1) and (2) a lawyer may take any lawful measure within the scope of representation that is reasonably calculated to advance a client’s objectives as defined by the client, consulting with the client as required by § 20.</p>

<p>(4) A client may ratify an act of a lawyer that was not previously authorized.</p>

A lawyer’s authority in the absence of an agreement or instruction. A lawyer has authority to take any lawful measure within the scope of representation (see § 19) that is reasonably calculated to advance a client’s objectives as defined by the client (see § 16), unless there is a contrary agreement or instruction and unless a decision is reserved to the client (see § 22). A lawyer, for example, may decide whether to move to dismiss a complaint and what discovery to pursue or resist. Absent a contrary agreement, instruction, or legal obligation (see § 23(2)), a lawyer thus remains free to exercise restraint, to accommodate reasonable requests of opposing counsel, and generally to conduct the representation in the same manner that the lawyer would recommend to other professional colleagues.</h6>

During a hearing, for example, decision must be made whether to object to another party’s question, probe further answers of a witness, or seek a curative instruction. Such matters often involve technical legal and strategic considerations difficult for a client to assess. Sometimes a lawyer cannot reach a client within the time during which a decision must be made. In the absence of a contrary agreement or instruction, lawyers have authority to make such decisions. Generally, in making such decisions, the lawyer properly takes into account moral considerations and appropriate courtroom and professional decorum.</h6>

As between lawyer and client, ratification does not absolve the lawyer if the client was obliged to affirm the lawyer’s act in order to protect the client’s interests or was induced to ratify by the lawyer’s misrepresentation or other misconduct.

<p>(2) A client may not validly authorize a lawyer to make the decisions described in Subsection (1) when other law (such as criminal-procedure rules governing pleas, jury-trial waiver, and defendant testimony) requires the client’s personal participation or approval.</p>

<p>(1) When a client’s capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with the representation is diminished, whether because of minority, physical illness, mental disability, or other cause, the lawyer must, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client and act in the best interests of the client as stated in Subsection (2).</p>

<p>(2) A lawyer representing a client with diminished capacity as described in Subsection (1) and for whom no guardian or other representative is available to act, must, with respect to a matter within the scope of the representation, pursue the lawyer’s reasonable view of the client’s objectives or interests as the client would define them if able to make adequately considered decisions on the matter, even if the client expresses no wishes or gives contrary instructions.</p>

<p>(3) If a client with diminished capacity as described in Subsection (1) has a guardian or other person legally entitled to act for the client, the client’s lawyer must treat that person as entitled to act with respect to the client’s interests in the matter, unless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the lawyer represents the client in a matter against the interests of that person; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) that person instructs the lawyer to act in a manner that the lawyer knows will violate the person’s legal duties toward the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(4) A lawyer representing a client with diminished capacity as described in Subsection (1) may seek the appointment of a guardian or take other protective action within the scope of the representation when doing so is practical and will advance the client’s objectives or interests, determined as stated in Subsection (2).</p>

Clients should not be unnecessarily deprived of their right to control their own affairs on account of such disabilities. Lawyers, moreover, should be careful not to construe as proof of disability a client’s insistence on a view of the client’s welfare that a lawyer considers unwise or otherwise at variance with the lawyer’s own views.</h6>

The lawyer should take reasonable steps to elicit the client’s own views on decisions necessary to the representation. Sometimes the use of a relative, therapist, or other intermediary may facilitate communication (see §§ 70 &amp; 71). Even when the lawyer is empowered to make decisions for the client (see Comment d), the lawyer should, if practical, communicate the proposed decision to the client so that the client will have a chance to comment, remonstrate, or seek help elsewhere. A lawyer may properly withhold from a disabled client information that would harm the client, for example when showing a psychiatric report to a mentally-ill client would be likely to cause the client to attempt suicide, harm another person, or otherwise act unlawfully (see § 20, Comment b, &amp; § 46, Comment c).</h6>

Even when that person is not also a co-client, the lawyer may provide confidential client information to the person to the extent appropriate in providing representation to the client (see § 61). If the disclosure is to be made to a nonclient and there is a significant risk that the information may be used adversely to the client, the lawyer should consult with the client concerning such disclosure.</h6>

The lawyer should adhere, to the extent reasonably possible, to the lawyer’s usual function as advocate and agent of the client, not judge or guardian, unless the lawyer’s role in the situation is modified by other law. The lawyer should, for example, help the client oppose confinement as a juvenile delinquent even though the lawyer believes that confinement would be in the long-term interests of the client and has unsuccessfully urged the client to accept confinement. Advancing the latter position should be left to opposing counsel.</h6>

Deciding for a client with diminished capacity. When a client’s disability prevents maintaining a normal client-lawyer relationship and there is no guardian or other legal representative to make decisions for the client, the lawyer may be justified in making decisions with respect to questions within the scope of the representation that would normally be made by the client. A lawyer should act only on a reasonable belief, based on appropriate investigation, that the client is unable to make an adequately considered decision rather than simply being confused or misguided. Because a disability might vary from time to time, the lawyer must reasonably believe that the client is unable to make an adequately considered decision without prejudicial delay.</h6>

Where practicable and reasonably available, independent professional evaluation of the client’s capacity may be sought. If a conflict of interest between client and lawyer is involved (see § 125), disinterested evaluation by another lawyer may be appropriate. Careful consideration is required of the client’s circumstances, problems, needs, character, and values, including interests of the client beyond the matter in which the lawyer represents the client. If the client, when able to decide, had expressed views relevant to the decision, the lawyer should follow them unless there is reason to believe that changed circumstances would change those views. The lawyer should also give appropriate weight to the client’s presently expressed views.</h6>

A proceeding seeking appointment of a guardian for the client is one example (see Comment e). A lawyer may also raise the issue of the client’s incompetence to stand trial in a criminal prosecution or, when a client is incompetent to stand trial, interpose the insanity defense. In such situations, the court and the adversary process provide some check on the lawyer’s decision.</h6>

For example, when a court appoints a lawyer to represent a young child, it may consider the lawyer to be in effect the child’s guardian ad litem. When a client already has a guardian but retains counsel to proceed against that guardian, a court often will not appoint a second guardian to make litigation decisions for the client. Other situations exist in which appointment of a guardian would be too expensive, traumatic, or otherwise undesirable or impractical in the circumstances.</h6>

Representing a client for whom a guardian or similar person may act. When a guardian has been appointed, the guardian normally speaks for the client as to matters covered by the guardianship. (When under the law of the jurisdiction a client’s power of attorney remains in effect during a disability, the appointee has such authority.) The lawyer therefore should normally follow the decisions of the guardian as if they were those of the client. That principle does not apply when the lawyer is representing the client in proceedings against the guardian, for example, in an attempt to have the guardianship terminated or its terms altered. The law sometimes authorizes the client to bypass a guardian—for example, when a mature minor seeks a court order authorizing her to have an abortion without having to disclose her pregnancy to her parents or guardians. The lawyer may also believe that the guardian is violating fiduciary duties owed to the client and may then seek relief setting aside the guardian’s decision or replacing the guardian (see also § 51(4)). If the lawyer believes the guardian to be acting lawfully but inconsistently with the best interests of the client, the lawyer may remonstrate with the guardian or withdraw under § 32(3)(d) (see § 23, Comment c).</h6>

With respect to the rights of a third person, the client is bound when a case is lost or a negotiation handled disadvantageously by a lawyer. Attributing the acts of lawyers to their clients is warranted by the fact that, in an important sense, they really are acts authorized by the principal. Much serious activity in business and personal affairs is done through lawyers. The same considerations apply, with qualifications, in holding the client liable for certain wrongs committed by the lawyer (see Comment d hereto).</h6>

A client might have authorized a lawyer’s conduct only in general terms, without contemplating the particular acts that lead to liability. However, it has been regarded as more appropriate for costs flowing from a lawyer’s misconduct generally to be borne by the client rather than by an innocent third person. Where the lawyer rather than the client is directly to blame, the client may be able to recover any losses by suing the lawyer, a right not generally accorded to nonclients (see Chapter 4). In practice, however, clients are sometimes unable to control their lawyer’s conduct and accordingly may sometimes be excused from the consequences of their lawyer’s behavior when that can be done without seriously harming others (see § 29).</h6>

Rationale. Under the law of agency, a client is bound by the lawyer’s act or failure to act when the client has vested the lawyer with apparent authority—an appearance of authority arising from and in accordance with the client’s manifestations to third persons (see Restatement Second, Agency § 8). Apparent authority can be identical to, greater, or less than a lawyer’s actual authority (see id. Comment a). The concepts of actual and apparent authority often lead to similar results. The same acts or statements of a client that confer actual authority can serve to manifest authority to a third person and vice versa. Apparent authority extends beyond actual authority in a lawyer’s transactions with third persons when the client has limited the lawyer’s actual authority but the limitation has not been disclosed to that person and, instead, the client has manifested to the third person that the lawyer has authority to act in the matter.</h6>

Permitting disavowal would allow clients at their convenience to ratify or disavow their lawyer’s acts despite the client’s inconsistent manifestation of the lawyer’s authority. It would also impose on the third person the burden of proving a fact better known to the client. A client usually can make clear to third persons the limited scope of a lawyer’s authority or take care to act in ways that do not manifest authority that the client does not intend.</h6>

Several safeguards are therefore included in the apparent-authority principle. First, the client must in fact have retained the lawyer or given the third party reason to believe that the client has done so. Second, the client’s own acts (including the act of retaining the lawyer) must have warranted a reasonable observer in believing that the client authorized the lawyer to act. Third, the third person must in fact have such a belief. The test thus includes both an objective and a subjective element (see Restatement Second, Agency § 27). In some circumstances courts will take into account the lawyer’s lack of actual authority in deciding whether to vacate a default (see § 29). If the client suffers detriment from a lawyer’s act performed with apparent but not actual authority, the client can recover from the lawyer for acting beyond the scope of the lawyer’s authority (see Comment f hereto &amp; § 30; Restatement Second, Agency § 383).</h6>

Apparent authority created by retention of a lawyer. By retaining a lawyer, a client implies that the lawyer is authorized to act for the client in matters relating to the representation and reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to carry it out. Circumstances known to the third person can narrow the scope of apparent authority thus conferred, for example statements by the client or lawyer that the lawyer is to handle only specified matters (see § 21(2) &amp; Comment d thereto). The client can also enlarge the lawyer’s apparent authority, for example by acquiescing, to the outsider’s knowledge, in the lawyer’s taking certain action. In the absence of such variations, a lawyer has apparent authority to do acts that reasonably appear to be calculated to advance the client’s objectives in the representation, except for matters reserved to the client under § 22. (For apparent authority with respect to matters reserved to the client, see Comment d hereto.)</h6>

The same standard applies in a proceeding before a tribunal. However, because of the lawyer’s broad actual authority in litigation (see §§ 21 &amp; 23), it will often be unnecessary to conduct a factual inquiry into whether a lawyer had apparent authority in the eyes of either the opposing party or the tribunal.</h6>

At Judge’s suggestion, Lawyer agrees that both parties to a civil action will waive further discovery and that the trial will begin the next week. Judge does not know, but opposing counsel does, that Lawyer’s Client (which has many similar cases) instructs its lawyers in writing not to bring cases to trial without specified discovery, some of which Lawyer has not yet accomplished. Although Lawyer lacked actual authority to waive discovery, Lawyer had apparent authority from Judge’s reasonable point of view, and Judge may hold Client to the trial date. Client’s remedies are to seek discretionary release from the waiver (see § 29) and to seek to recover any damages from Lawyer for acting beyond authority (see Comment f hereto &amp; § 30).</h6>

At a pretrial conference in a medical-malpractice case, Lawyer agrees with opposing counsel that neither party will call more than one expert witness at the trial. Opposing counsel is not aware that Lawyer’s client (which has many similar cases) instructs its lawyers to present expert testimony from at least two witnesses in every medical-malpractice case involving more than a certain amount in claimed damages. Judge knows of the client’s practice but does not inform opposing counsel. The opposing party can hold Lawyer’s client to the contract, which Lawyer had apparent authority to make, unless the court releases the parties from the contract (see § 29).</h6>

Lawyer’s apparent authority to settle and perform other acts reserved to a client. Generally a client is not bound by a settlement that the client has not authorized a lawyer to make by express, implied, or apparent authority (and that is not validated by later ratification under § 26(3)). Merely retaining a lawyer does not create apparent authority in the lawyer to perform acts governed by § 22. When a lawyer purports to enter a settlement binding on the client but lacks authority to do so, the burden of inconvenience resulting if the client repudiates the settlement is properly left with the opposing party, who should know that settlements are normally subject to approval by the client and who has no manifested contrary indication from the client. The opposing party can protect itself by obtaining clarification of the lawyer’s authority. Refusing to uphold a settlement reached without the client’s authority means that the case remains open, while upholding such a settlement deprives the client of the right to have the claim resolved on other terms.</h6>

Recovery against a lawyer. When a client is bound by an act of a lawyer with apparent but not actual authority, a lawyer is subject to liability to the client for any resulting damages to the client, unless the lawyer reasonably believed that the act was authorized by the client (see Restatement Second, Agency § 383; §§ 16, 21, &amp; 22 hereto). The lawyer can also be subject to professional discipline (see § 5) or procedural sanctions (see § 110) for harming the interests of a client through action taken without the client’s consent.</h6>

Liability can be based on implied warranty of actual authority or on misrepresentation of the lawyer’s authority (see § 30; Restatement Second, Agency §§ 329 &amp; 330). The lawyer is also subject to liability for damages to the client, for example the client’s expenses of having the act declared not to be binding (see § 53, Comment f (client’s recovery of legal fees in such an instance)).</h6>

<h2 id="-28-a-lawyers-knowledge-notification-to-a-lawyer-and-statements-of-a-lawyer">§ 28. A Lawyer’s Knowledge; Notification to a Lawyer; and Statements of a Lawyer</h2>

<p>(1) Information imparted to a lawyer during and relating to the representation of a client is attributed to the client for the purpose of determining the client’s rights and liabilities in matters in which the lawyer represents the client, unless those rights or liabilities require proof of the client’s personal knowledge or intentions or the lawyer’s legal duties preclude disclosure of the information to the client.</p>

<p>(2) Unless applicable law otherwise provides, a third person may give notification to a client, in a matter in which the client is represented by a lawyer, by giving notification to the client’s lawyer, unless the third person knows of circumstances reasonably indicating that the lawyer’s authority to receive notification has been abrogated.</p>

<p>(3) A lawyer’s unprivileged statement is admissible in evidence against a client as if it were the client’s statement if either:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the client authorized the lawyer to make a statement concerning the subject; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the statement concerns a matter within the scope of the representation and was made by the lawyer during it.</p>

<p>(2) In deciding whether to impose a sanction on a person or to relieve a person from a criminal or civil ruling, default, or judgment, a tribunal may consider otherwise admissible evidence to prove or disprove that the lawyer who represented the person did so inadequately or contrary to the client’s instructions.</p>

<h2 id="-30-a-lawyers-liability-to-a-third-person-for-conduct-on-behalf-of-a-client">§ 30. A Lawyer’s Liability to a Third Person for Conduct on Behalf of a Client</h2>

<p>(1) For improper conduct while representing a client, a lawyer is subject to professional discipline as stated in § 5, to civil liability as stated in Chapter 4, and to prosecution as provided in the criminal law (see § 7).</p>

<p>(2) Unless at the time of contracting the lawyer or third person disclaimed such liability, a lawyer is subject to liability to third persons on contracts the lawyer entered into on behalf of a client if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the client’s existence or identity was not disclosed to the third person; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the contract is between the lawyer and a third person who provides goods or services used by lawyers and who, as the lawyer knows or reasonably should know, relies on the lawyer’s credit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) A lawyer is subject to liability to a third person for damages for loss proximately caused by the lawyer’s acting without authority from a client under § 26 if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the lawyer tortiously misrepresents to the third person that the lawyer has authority to make a contract, conveyance, or affirmation on behalf of the client and thethird person reasonably relies on the misrepresentation; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer purports to make a contract, conveyance, or affirmation on behalf of the client, unless the lawyer manifests that the lawyer does not warrant that the lawyer is authorized to act or the other party knows that the lawyer is not authorized to act.</p>

<h2 id="-31-termination-of-a-lawyers-authority">§ 31. Termination of a Lawyer’s Authority</h2>

<p>(1) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation and with an order of a tribunal requiring the representation to continue.</p>

<p>(2) Subject to Subsection (1) and § 33, a lawyer’s actual authority to represent a client ends when:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the client discharges the lawyer;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the client dies or, in the case of a corporation or similar organization, loses its capacity to function as such;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the lawyer withdraws;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) the lawyer dies or becomes physically or mentally incapable of providing representation, is disbarred or suspended from practicing law, or is ordered by a tribunal to cease representing a client; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(e) the representation ends as provided by contract or because the lawyer has completed the contemplated services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) A lawyer’s apparent authority to act for a client with respect to another person ends when the other person knows or should know of facts from which it can be reasonably inferred that the lawyer lacks actual authority, including knowledge of any event described in Subsection (2).</p>

<h2 id="-32-discharge-by-a-client-and-withdrawal-by-a-lawyer">§ 32. Discharge by a Client and Withdrawal by a Lawyer</h2>

<p>(1) Subject to Subsection (5), a client may discharge a lawyer at any time.</p>

<p>(2) Subject to Subsection (5), a lawyer may not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, must withdraw from the representation of a client if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the representation will result in the lawyer’s violating rules of professional conduct or other law;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer’s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer’s ability to represent the client; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the client discharges the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) Subject to Subsections (4) and (5), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer reasonably believes withdrawal is required in circumstances stated in Subsection (2);</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the client gives informed consent;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer’s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal, fraudulent, or in breach of the client’s fiduciary duty;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(e) the lawyer reasonably believes the client has used or threatens to use the lawyer’s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(f) the client insists on taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant or imprudent;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(g) the client fails to fulfill a substantial financial or other obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer’s services and the lawyer has given the client reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the client fulfills the obligation;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(h) the representation has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client or by the irreparable breakdown of the client-lawyer relationship; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) other good cause for withdrawal exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(4) In the case of permissive withdrawal under Subsections (3)(f)-(i), a lawyer may not withdraw if the harm that withdrawal would cause significantly exceeds the harm to the lawyer or others in not withdrawing.</p>

<p>(5) Notwithstanding Subsections (1)-(4), a lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation and with a valid order of a tribunal requiring the representation to continue.</p>

<h2 id="-33-a-lawyers-duties-when-a-representation-terminates">§ 33. A Lawyer’s Duties When a Representation Terminates</h2>

<p>(1) In terminating a representation, a lawyer must take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect the client’s interests, such as giving notice to the client of the termination, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee the lawyer has not earned.</p>

<p>(2) Following termination of a representation, a lawyer must:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) observe obligations to a former client such as those dealing with client confidences (see Chapter 5), conflicts of interest (see Chapter 8), client property and documents (see §§ 44-46), and fee collection (see § 41);</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) take no action on behalf of a former client without new authorization and give reasonable notice, to those who might otherwise be misled, that the lawyer lacks authority to act for the client;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) take reasonable steps to convey to the former client any material communication the lawyer receives relating to the matter involved in the representation; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) take no unfair advantage of a former client by abusing knowledge or trust acquired by means of the representation.</p>
</blockquote>
