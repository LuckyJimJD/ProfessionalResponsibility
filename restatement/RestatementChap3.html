<h2 id="-34-reasonable-and-lawful-fees">§ 34. Reasonable and Lawful Fees</h2>

<p>A lawyer may not charge a fee larger than is reasonable in the circumstances or that is prohibited by law.</p>

<h2 id="-35-contingent-fee-arrangements">§ 35. Contingent-Fee Arrangements</h2>

<p>(1) A lawyer may contract with a client for a fee the size or payment of which is contingent on the outcome of a matter, unless the contract violates § 34 or another provision of this Restatement or the size or payment of the fee is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) contingent on success in prosecuting or defending a criminal proceeding; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) contingent on a specified result in a divorce proceeding or a proceeding concerning custody of a child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2) Unless the contract construed in the circumstances indicates otherwise, when a lawyer has contracted for a contingent fee, the lawyer is entitled to receive the specified fee only when and to the extent the client receives payment.</p>

<h2 id="-36-forbidden-client-lawyer-financial-arrangements">§ 36. Forbidden Client-Lawyer Financial Arrangements</h2>

<p>(1) A lawyer may not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation that the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) acquire a lien as provided by § 43 to secure the lawyer’s fee or expenses; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) contract with a client for a contingent fee in a civil case except when prohibited as stated in § 35.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2) A lawyer may not make or guarantee a loan to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation that the lawyer is conducting for the client, except that the lawyer may make or guarantee a loan covering court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which to the lawyer may be contingent on the outcome of the matter.</p>

<p>(3) A lawyer may not, before the lawyer ceases to represent a client, make an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.</p>

<h2 id="-37-partial-or-complete-forfeiture-of-a-lawyers-compensation">§ 37. Partial or Complete Forfeiture of a Lawyer’s Compensation</h2>

<p>A lawyer engaging in clear and serious violation of duty to a client may be required to forfeit some or all of the lawyer’s compensation for the matter. Considerations relevant to the question of forfeiture include the gravity and timing of the violation, its willfulness, its effect on the value of the lawyer’s work for the client, any other threatened or actual harm to the client, and the adequacy of other remedies.</p>

Scope and cross-references; relation to other doctrines. Even if a fee is otherwise reasonable (see § 34) and complies with the other requirements of this Chapter, this Section can in some circumstances lead to forfeiture. See also § 41, on abusive fee-collection methods, and § 43, Comments f and g, discussing the discharge of attorney liens. A client who has already paid a fee subject to forfeiture can sue to recover it (see §§ 33(1) &amp; 42).</h6>

A lawyer is not entitled to be paid for services rendered in violation of the lawyer’s duty to a client or for services needed to alleviate the consequences of the lawyer’s misconduct. See Restatement Second, Agency § 469 (agent entitled to no compensation for conduct which is disobedient or breach of duty of loyalty to principal). A tribunal will also consider misconduct more broadly, as evidence of the lawyer’s lack of competence and loyalty, and hence of the value of the lawyer’s services.</h6>

Lawyer has been retained at an hourly rate to negotiate a contract for Client. Lawyer assures the other parties that Client has consented to a given term, knowing this to be incorrect. Lawyer devotes five hours to working out the details of the term. When Client insists that the term be stricken (see § 22), Lawyer devotes four more hours to explaining to the other parties that Lawyer’s lack of authority and Client’s rejection of the term requires further negotiations. Lawyer is not entitled to compensation for any of those nine hours of time under either § 34 or § 39. The tribunal, moreover, may properly consider the incident if it bears on the value of such of Lawyer’s other time as is otherwise reasonably compensable.</h6>

Thus under contract law the misconduct could constitute a material breach of contract (see § 40) or vitiate the formation of the contract (as in the case of misrepresentations concerning the lawyer’s credentials). Alternatively, the contract can be unenforceable because it contains an unlawful provision (see Restatement Second, Contracts §§ 163, 164, 184, 237, 241, &amp; 374; Restatement Second, Agency § 467). In some cases, although the contract is unenforceable on its own terms, the lawyer will still be able to recover the fair value of services rendered (see § 39, Comment e).</h6>

Malpractice damages can be greater or smaller than the forfeited fees. Conduct constituting malpractice is not always the same as conduct warranting fee forfeiture. A lawyer’s negligent legal research, for example, might constitute malpractice, but will not necessarily lead to fee forfeiture. On malpractice liability and measures of damages generally, see § 53. On the duty of an agent to recompense a principal for loss caused by the agent’s breach of duty, see Restatement Second, Agency § 401.</h6>

Rationale. The remedy of fee forfeiture presupposes that a lawyer’s clear and serious violation of a duty to a client destroys or severely impairs the client-lawyer relationship and thereby the justification of the lawyer’s claim to compensation. See Restatement Second, Trusts § 243 (court has discretion to deny or reduce compensation of trustee who commits breach of trust); cf. Restatement Second, Agency § 456(b) (willful and deliberate breach disentitles agent to recover in quantum meruit when agency contract does not apportion compensation). Forfeiture is also a deterrent. The damage that misconduct causes is often difficult to assess. In addition, a tribunal often can determine a forfeiture sanction more easily than a right to compensating damages.</h6>

Some violations are inadvertent or do not significantly harm the client. Some can be adequately dealt with by the remedies described in Comment a or by a partial forfeiture (see Comment e). Denying the lawyer all compensation would sometimes be an excessive sanction, giving a windfall to a client. The remedy of this Section should hence be applied with discretion.</h6>

Violation of a duty to a client. This Section provides for forfeiture when a lawyer engages in a clear and serious violation (see Comment d hereto) of a duty to the client. The source of the duty can be civil or criminal law, including, for example, the requirements of an applicable lawyer code or the law of malpractice. The misconduct might have occurred when the lawyer was retained, during the representation, or during attempts to collect a fee (see § 41). On improper withdrawal as a ground for forfeiture, see § 40, Comment e.</h6>

That a lawyer, for example, harassed an opponent in litigation without harming the client does not warrant relieving the client of any duty to pay the lawyer. On other remedies in such situations, see § 110. But sometimes harassing a nonclient will also violate the lawyer’s duty to the client, perhaps exposing the client to demands for sanctions or making the client’s cause less likely to prevail. Forfeiture will then be appropriate unless the client is primarily responsible for the breach of duty to a nonclient.</h6>

A clear and serious violation—relevant factors. A lawyer’s violation of duty to a client warrants fee forfeiture only if the lawyer’s violation was clear. A violation is clear if a reasonable lawyer, knowing the relevant facts and law reasonably accessible to the lawyer, would have known that the conduct was wrongful. The sanction of fee forfeiture should not be applied to a lawyer who could not have been expected to know that conduct was forbidden, for example when the lawyer followed one reasonable interpretation of a client-lawyer contract and another interpretation was later held correct.</h6>

<h6 id="to-warrant-fee-forfeiture-a-lawyers-violation-must-also-be-serious-minor-violations-do-not-justify-leaving-the-lawyer-entirely-unpaid-for-valuable-services-rendered-to-a-client-although-some-such-violations-will-reduce-the-size-of-the-fee-or-render-the-lawyer-liable-to-the-client-for-any-harm-caused-see-comment-a-hereto">To warrant fee forfeiture a lawyer’s violation must also be serious. Minor violations do not justify leaving the lawyer entirely unpaid for valuable services rendered to a client, although some such violations will reduce the size of the fee or render the lawyer liable to the client for any harm caused (see Comment a hereto).</h6>

<h6 id="in-approaching-the-ultimate-issue-of-whether-violation-of-duty-warrants-fee-forfeiture-several-factors-are-relevant-the-extent-of-the-misconduct-is-one-factor-normally-forfeiture-is-more-appropriate-for-repeated-or-continuing-violations-than-for-a-single-incident-whether-the-breach-involved-knowing-violation-or-conscious-disloyalty-to-a-client-is-also-relevant-see-restatement-second-agency--469-forfeiture-for-willful-and-deliberate-breach-forfeiture-is-generally-inappropriate-when-the-lawyer-has-not-done-anything-willfully-blameworthy-for-example-when-a-conflict-of-interest-arises-during-a-representation-because-of-the-unexpected-act-of-a-client-or-third-person">In approaching the ultimate issue of whether violation of duty warrants fee forfeiture, several factors are relevant. The extent of the misconduct is one factor. Normally, forfeiture is more appropriate for repeated or continuing violations than for a single incident. Whether the breach involved knowing violation or conscious disloyalty to a client is also relevant. See Restatement Second, Agency § 469 (forfeiture for willful and deliberate breach). Forfeiture is generally inappropriate when the lawyer has not done anything willfully blameworthy, for example, when a conflict of interest arises during a representation because of the unexpected act of a client or third person.</h6>

<h6 id="forfeiture-should-be-proportionate-to-the-seriousness-of-the-offense-for-example-a-lawyers-failure-to-keep-a-clients-funds-segregated-in-a-separate-account-see--44-should-not-result-in-forfeiture-if-the-funds-are-preserved-undiminished-for-the-client-but-forfeiture-is-justified-for-a-flagrant-violation-even-though-no-harm-can-be-proved">Forfeiture should be proportionate to the seriousness of the offense. For example, a lawyer’s failure to keep a client’s funds segregated in a separate account (see § 44) should not result in forfeiture if the funds are preserved undiminished for the client. But forfeiture is justified for a flagrant violation even though no harm can be proved.</h6>

<h6 id="the-adequacy-of-other-remedies-is-also-relevant-if-for-example-a-lawyer-improperly-withdraws-from-a-representation-and-is-consequently-limited-to-a-quantum-meruit-recovery-significantly-smaller-than-the-fee-contract-provided-see--40-it-might-be-unnecessary-to-forfeit-the-quantum-meruit-recovery-as-well">The adequacy of other remedies is also relevant. If, for example, a lawyer improperly withdraws from a representation and is consequently limited to a quantum meruit recovery significantly smaller than the fee contract provided (see § 40), it might be unnecessary to forfeit the quantum meruit recovery as well.</h6>

<h6 id="e-extent-of-forfeiture-ordinarily-forfeiture-extends-to-all-fees-for-the-matter-for-which-the-lawyer-was-retained-such-as-defending-a-criminal-prosecution-or-incorporating-a-corporation-for-a-possibly-more-limited-loss-of-fees-under-other-rules-see-comment-a-hereto-see--42-clients-suit-for-refund-of-fees-already-paid-forfeiture-does-not-extend-to-a-disbursement-made-by-the-lawyer-to-the-extent-it-has-conferred-a-benefit-on-the-client-see--40-comment-d">e. Extent of forfeiture. Ordinarily, forfeiture extends to all fees for the matter for which the lawyer was retained, such as defending a criminal prosecution or incorporating a corporation. (For a possibly more limited loss of fees under other rules, see Comment a hereto.) See § 42 (client’s suit for refund of fees already paid). Forfeiture does not extend to a disbursement made by the lawyer to the extent it has conferred a benefit on the client (see § 40, Comment d).</h6>

<h6 id="sometimes-forfeiture-for-the-entire-matter-is-inappropriate-for-example-when-a-lawyer-performed-valuable-services-before-the-misconduct-began-and-the-misconduct-was-not-so-grave-as-to-require-forfeiture-of-the-fee-for-all-services-ultimately-the-question-is-one-of-fairness-in-view-of-the-seriousness-of-the-lawyers-violation-and-considering-the-special-duties-imposed-on-lawyers-the-gravity-timing-and-likely-consequences-to-the-client-of-the-lawyers-misbehavior-and-the-connection-between-the-various-services-performed-by-the-lawyer">Sometimes forfeiture for the entire matter is inappropriate, for example when a lawyer performed valuable services before the misconduct began, and the misconduct was not so grave as to require forfeiture of the fee for all services. Ultimately the question is one of fairness in view of the seriousness of the lawyer’s violation and considering the special duties imposed on lawyers, the gravity, timing, and likely consequences to the client of the lawyer’s misbehavior, and the connection between the various services performed by the lawyer.</h6>

<h6 id="when-a-lawyer-employee-of-a-client-is-discharged-for-misconduct-except-in-an-extreme-instance-this-section-does-not-warrant-forfeiture-of-all-earned-salary-and-pension-entitlements-otherwise-due-the-lawyers-loss-of-employment-will-itself-often-be-a-penalty-graver-than-would-be-the-loss-of-a-fee-for-a-single-matter-for-a-nonemployee-lawyer-employers-moreover-are-often-in-a-better-position-to-protect-themselves-against-misconduct-of-their-lawyer-employees-through-supervision-and-other-means-see-comment-a-hereto-restatement-second-agency--401-for-an-employers-liability-for-unjust-discharge-of-a-lawyer-employee-see--32-comment-b">When a lawyer-employee of a client is discharged for misconduct, except in an extreme instance this Section does not warrant forfeiture of all earned salary and pension entitlements otherwise due. The lawyer’s loss of employment will itself often be a penalty graver than would be the loss of a fee for a single matter for a nonemployee lawyer. Employers, moreover, are often in a better position to protect themselves against misconduct of their lawyer-employees through supervision and other means. See Comment a hereto; Restatement Second, Agency § 401. For an employer’s liability for unjust discharge of a lawyer employee, see § 32, Comment b.</h6>

<p>(1) Before or within a reasonable time after beginning to represent a client in a matter, a lawyer must communicate to the client, in writing when applicable rules so provide, the basis or rate of the fee, unless the communication is unnecessary for the client because the lawyer has previously represented that client on the same basis or at the same rate.</p>

<p>(2) The validity and construction of a contract between a client and a lawyer concerning the lawyer’s fees are governed by § 18.</p>

<p>(3) Unless a contract construed in the circumstances indicates otherwise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) a lawyer may not charge separately for the lawyer’s general office and overhead expenses;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) payments that the law requires an opposing party or that party’s lawyer to pay as attorney-fee awards or sanctions are credited to the client, not the client’s lawyer, absent a contrary statute or court order; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) when a lawyer requests and receives a fee payment that is not for services already rendered, that payment is to be credited against whatever fee the lawyer is entitled to collect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-39-a-lawyers-fee-in-the-absence-of-a-contract">§ 39. A Lawyer’s Fee in the Absence of a Contract</h2>

<p>If a client and lawyer have not made a valid contract providing for another measure of compensation, a client owes a lawyer who has performed legal services for the client the fair value of the lawyer’s services.</p>

<h2 id="-40-fees-on-termination">§ 40. Fees on Termination</h2>

<p>If a client-lawyer relationship ends before the lawyer has completed the services due for a matter and the lawyer’s fee has not been forfeited under § 37:</p>

<p>(1) a lawyer who has been discharged or withdraws may recover the lesser of the fair value of the lawyer’s services as determined under § 39 and the ratable proportion of the compensation provided by any otherwise enforceable contract between lawyer and client for the services performed; except that</p>

<p>(2) the tribunal may allow such a lawyer to recover the ratable proportion of the compensation provided by such a contract if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the discharge or withdrawal is not attributable to misconduct of the lawyer;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer has performed severable services; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) allowing contractual compensation would not burden the client’s choice of counsel or the client’s ability to replace counsel.</p>

Measure of compensation when a client discharges a lawyer. A client might discharge a lawyer before substantial completion of the services. . Some older decisions reason that such a lawyer, not having violated the contract, is entitled to receive the contractual fee less the value of any services the lawyer avoided by being discharged. Alternatively, it could be argued that the lawyer should be able to treat the contract as revoked and recover in quantum meruit under § 39 the fair value of whatever services the lawyer rendered, even if that recovery exceeds the contractual price.</h6>

The discharged lawyer has not completed the work for which the contractual fee was due. Noncompletion results not from any improper act of the client, but from the client’s exercise of the right to discharge counsel (see § 32). That right should not be encumbered by permitting the lawyer the option of either recovery at the contractual rate or in quantum meruit without appropriate adjustment for work yet to be performed.</h6>

Client retained Lawyer to handle Client’s divorce. Lawyer requested and Client paid $2,000 in advance, as full payment. After Lawyer had worked eight hours out of the approximately 16 likely to be needed, Client discharged Lawyer in order to hire Client’s brother. (a) If the fair value of Lawyer’s work is $100 per hour, Lawyer is entitled to $800 for the eight hours actually worked. Lawyer must refund the rest of the $2,000. (b) If the fair value of Lawyer’s work is $300 per hour, Lawyer is entitled to that part of the $2,000 applicable to the work performed, that is to $1,000 and not the fair value of $2,400, because $1,000 was the contractual price for the work Lawyer performed, which was approximately half of the work actually contemplated. Lawyer is not entitled to the full $2,000 lump-sum fee because that fee contemplated performance of all work involved in Client’s divorce. Accordingly, the $2,000 must be prorated to reflect the extent of Lawyer’s actual services.</h6>

If $100 is the fair value of Lawyer’s services, Lawyer is entitled to $800 for the eight hours worked.

Client retained Lawyer to bring a tort suit for a contingent fee of one-third of any recovery. Client discharged Lawyer after Lawyer had worked 100 hours, because Client found Lawyer’s manner overbearing. The fair value of Lawyer’s time is $100 per hour. Until Client prevails in the suit, Lawyer has no right to a fee, because under the contract no fee was due unless and until Client recovered (see § 38(3)(d)). If Client recovers $60,000, Lawyer is entitled to $10,000, which is the lesser of the contractual fee ($20,000) and the fair value of Lawyer’s services (100 hours at $100 per hour, or $10,000).</h6>

<h1 id="topic-3-fee-collection-procedures">Topic 3. Fee-Collection Procedures</h1>

<h2 id="-41-fee-collection-methods">§ 41. Fee-Collection Methods</h2>

<p>In seeking compensation claimed from a client or former client, a lawyer may not employ collection methods forbidden by law, use confidential information (as defined in Chapter 5) when not permitted under § 65, or harass the client.</p>

<h2 id="-42-remedies-and-the-burden-of-persuasion">§ 42. Remedies and the Burden of Persuasion</h2>

<p>(1) A fee dispute between a lawyer and a client may be adjudicated in any appropriate proceeding, including a suit by the lawyer to recover an unpaid fee, a suit for a refund by a client, an arbitration to which both parties consent unless applicable law renders the lawyer’s consent unnecessary, or in the court’s discretion a proceeding ancillary to a pending suit in which the lawyer performed the services in question.</p>

<p>(2) In any such proceeding the lawyer has the burden of persuading the trier of fact, when relevant, of the existence and terms of any fee contract, the making of any disclosures to the client required to render a contract enforceable, and the extent and value of the lawyer’s services.</p>

<h2 id="-43-lawyer-liens">§ 43. Lawyer Liens</h2>

<p>(1) Except as provided in Subsection (2) or by statute or rule, a lawyer does not acquire a lien entitling the lawyer to retain the client’s property in the lawyer’s possession in order to secure payment of the lawyer’s fees and disbursements. A lawyer may decline to deliver to a client or former client an original or copy of any document prepared by the lawyer or at the lawyer’s expense if the client or former client has not paid all fees and disbursements due for the lawyer’s work in preparing the document and nondelivery would not unreasonably harm the client or former client.</p>

<p>(2) Unless otherwise provided by statute or rule, client and lawyer may agree that the lawyer shall have a security interest in property of the client recovered for the client through the lawyer’s efforts, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the lawyer may contract in writing with the client for a lien on the proceeds of the representation to secure payment for the lawyer’s services and disbursements in that matter;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lien becomes binding on a third party when the party has notice of the lien;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the lien applies only to the amount of fees and disbursements claimed reasonably and in good faith for the lawyer’s services performed in the representation; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) the lawyer may not unreasonably impede the speedy and inexpensive resolution of any dispute concerning those fees and disbursements or the lien.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) A tribunal where an action is pending may in its discretion adjudicate any fee or other dispute concerning a lien asserted by a lawyer on property of a party to the action, provide for custody of the property, release all or part of the property to the client or lawyer, and grant such other relief as justice may require.</p>

<p>(4) With respect to property neither in the lawyer’s possession nor recovered by the client through the lawyer’s efforts, the lawyer may obtain a security interest on property of a client only as provided by other law and consistent with §§ 18 and 126. Acquisition of such a security interest is a business or financial transaction with a client within the meaning of § 126.</p>

<h2 id="-44-safeguarding-and-segregating-property">§ 44. Safeguarding and Segregating Property</h2>

<p>(1) A lawyer holding funds or other property of a client in connection with a representation, or such funds or other property in which a client claims an interest, must take reasonable steps to safeguard the funds or property. A similar obligation may be imposed by law on funds or other property so held and owned or claimed by a third person. In particular, the lawyer must hold such property separate from the lawyer’s property, keep records of it, deposit funds in an account separate from the lawyer’s own funds, identify tangible objects, and comply with related requirements imposed by regulatory authorities.</p>

<p>(2) Upon receiving funds or other property in a professional capacity and in which a client or third person owns or claims an interest, a lawyer must promptly notify the client or third person. The lawyer must promptly render a full accounting regarding such property upon request by the client or third person.</p>

<h2 id="-45-surrendering-possession-of-property">§ 45. Surrendering Possession of Property</h2>

<p>(1) Except as provided in Subsection (2), a lawyer must promptly deliver, to the client or nonclient so entitled, funds or other property in the lawyer’s possession belonging to a client or nonclient.</p>

<p>(2) A lawyer may retain possession of funds or other property of a client or nonclient if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the client or nonclient consents;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) the lawyer’s client is entitled to the property, the lawyer appropriately possesses the property for purposes of the representation, and the client has not asked for delivery of the property;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the lawyer has a valid lien on the property (see § 43);</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) there are substantial grounds for dispute as to the person entitled to the property; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(e) delivering the property to the client or nonclient would violate a court order or other legal obligation of the lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-46-documents-relating-to-a-representation">§ 46. Documents Relating to a Representation</h2>

<p>(1) A lawyer must take reasonable steps to safeguard documents in the lawyer’s possession relating to the representation of a client or former client.</p>

<p>(2) On request, a lawyer must allow a client or former client to inspect and copy any document possessed by the lawyer relating to the representation, unless substantial grounds exist to refuse.</p>

<p>(3) Unless a client or former client consents to nondelivery or substantial grounds exist for refusing to make delivery, a lawyer must deliver to the client or former client, at an appropriate time and in any event promptly after the representation ends, such originals and copies of other documents possessed by the lawyer relating to the representation as the client or former client reasonably needs.</p>

<p>(4) Notwithstanding Subsections (2) and (3), a lawyer may decline to deliver to a client or former client an original or copy of any document under circumstances permitted by § 43(1).</p>

<h2 id="-47-fee-splitting-between-lawyers-not-in-the-same-firm">§ 47. Fee-Splitting Between Lawyers Not in the Same Firm</h2>

<p>A division of fees between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if:</p>

<p>(1) (a) the division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or (b) by agreement with the client, the lawyers assume joint responsibility for the representation;</p>

<p>(2) the client is informed of and does not object to the fact of division, the terms of the division, and the participation of the lawyers involved; and</p>

<p>(3) the total fee is reasonable (see § 34).</p>
